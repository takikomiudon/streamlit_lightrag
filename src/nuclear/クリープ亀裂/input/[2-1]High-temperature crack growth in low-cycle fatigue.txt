Abstract-The    rates of low-cycle fatigue crack propagation in 1 Cr-1 MO-0.25 V low alloy steel were
determined under several types of loading at 1000 F. It was found that crack growth rates correlate well
with the nominal crack tip stress. This method was also applied with good results to some published data
where the fracture mechanics stress intensity factor had given only limited correlation. Several questions
are thus raised regarding the relative importance of crack tip stress and crack length during crack growth in
actual components.

                                            INTRODUCTION
WITHIN     THE  past twenty years numerous investigators have studied the parameters
controlling fatigue crack growth. A number of the earlier authors, namely Head[l],
Frost and Dugdale[2], McEvily and Illg[3], Liu[4]. Schijve[S], and Paris et a1.[6,7],
were principally concerned with high-cycle fatigue at room temperature. As each
experimenter obtained his results, he proposed a new relationship between fatigue
crack growth rate and alternating stress level and crack length. Paris and Erdogan [S] re-
viewed these relationships, and found that all the data could be well correlated by a
fourth power equation involving the fracture mechanics stress intensity factor:

                                               dL = (AK)4
                                               dN=    c ’
                                                                                                          (1)

    where:     AK = range of stress intensity factor
                 c = material constant
                 L = crack length
                N = number of cycles.

This application was a major extension of fracture mechanics concepts beyond the
analysis of brittle fracture.
     Both Forman et af.[9], and Roberts and Erdogan [lo] have proposed modifications
to (1) to better describe the effects of mean load.
     Crooker and Lange [ 111, Brothers and Yukawa[ 121 and McEvily et al. [ 131 have
investigated crack growth at higher stress levels, in a low-cycle fatigue range. The
first two groups have used the stress intensity factor power relation to correlate their
data, while the last group has used a similar ‘strain’ intensity factor. Thus, most authors

recently studying fatigue crack growth have used basically the same type of approach.
    The series of tests reported here take the next step in the study of fatigue crack
growth, i.e. the effects of high-temperature     creep. Here the application of the brittle
fracture-related  elastic stress intensity factor would be put to its severest test. And
if a completely new parameter were required to correlate the data, perhaps it would
shed light on crack growth under other conditions as well.


                                           EXPERIMENTATION
Material
    The 1 Cr-1 MO-0.25V steel test material was machined from a disk parted from a
steam turbine rotor. All of the specimens tested had an axial orientation in the disk,
so that crack growth was always in a radial direction in the original rotor.
    The average chemical composition of the test material is given in Table 1.
    In its final heat treatment the steel was normalized at 1775 F for 6 hr and air cooled,
then tempered at 1270 F for 12 hr and furnace cooled. The steel’s tensile properties
were determined at room temperature and at 1000 F. The results are shown on Table 2.
    The reduction in area after a 572 hr rupture test at 1000 F was 73.6 per cent.

Test specimen
    The test specimen used is shown in Fig. 1. It is 15 in. long, 5 in. wide, and 1 in.
thick, with a 2 in. long, 0.25 in. thick gage section. The 0.5 in. center notch was electro-
discharge-machined     allowing very accurate dimensioning of the notch without damag-
ing surrounding material through excessive heating.
    The specimens were coated with high-temperature            aluminum paint to prevent
surface oxidation and to permit accurate measurement of crack length. Crack growth
was measured using an aluminum coated scale graduated in 0.01 in. increments clamped
to the specimen (see Fig. 2). The crack was monitored with a 2 X telemicroscope.
Measuring accuracy for the crack length was of:0405 in.

 Test equipment
    A 200,000-lb, hydraulically operated, axial-load testing machine was employed in
this study. Sawtooth waveform cycling was used in zero to tension loading with a-+

Crack growth data
    Load controlled tests were run at 1000 F at gross section stress levels (excluding
the crack width) from 0 to 40,000 psi. 50,000 psi, and 60,000 psi in an air environment,
These data are shown in Fig. 4. An extension controlled test was also run, where the
extension limit corresponded to a stress of 70,000 psi, and the specimen was cycled
from zero stress to the maximum extension (see Fig. 5). Because the growing crack

decreased the net section of the specimen, and also because this material strain softens
at 1000 F, the gross section stress decreased as the test progressed.
     Figure 6 shows the results of a stepped load test, where the load was increased
once crack growth curves were obtained at each step. Figure 7 shows the results of
these tests plotted on the single load data of Figure 4. The crack length at start of cycling
at a new load is used as the reference in all cases. The prior load level seems to have
little effect on crack growth rate. Figure 8 shows data from a test that began as a decreas-
ing stepped load test. Here the prior load level had a substantial effect, depressing the
crack growth rate long after the load had been changed. After 62,500 lb the crack did
not grow for 1500 cycles at 50,000 lb, and after the load was dropped to 37,500 lb,
the crack did not grow for 4000 cycles. When the load was increased to 50,000 lb,
growth proceeded normally.

Microstructure
     Preliminary microstructural     examination has shown that all crack growth was
transgranular. At the low stress levels, the cracks grew very straight normal to the load
for up to O-8 in. total crack length. This period was followed in the low stress specimens
by substantial short branching. The main crack, however, would continue straight
until shear fracture started, at which time the crack direction would begin to change
to 45” to the load. All tests were stopped at this point. As test load level increased,
the frequency of branching decreased, until at o;, = 60,000 psi there was no branching
from the main crack.
    The size of the zone of gross plasticity at the crack tip, as evidenced by extensive
deformation of the bainite phase, was limited to about O-15 in. from the edge of the crack
in all tests.
    There was a normal distribution of silicate particles lying in a plane normal to the
forging direction. There appeared to be no interaction between these defects and the
growing cracks.


Fractography
     Fractographic  work on the test specimens has only begun. The first specimens
examined showed that a heavy oxide layer hid most fracture surface features in both
the specimens with the tightest cracks (low stressed specimens), and in those tested
for the shortest times (high stressed specimens). Fatigue striations could be seen only
near the fast fracture area, and there only faintly. Removal of the oxide is being
attempted using dilute HCl and an oxidation inhibitor. So far, this procedure
has revealed small patches of striations to within about gin. from the notch,
but few features of any kind closer to the notch. No evidence of ductile rupture has
been found.
    While crack growth is perpendicular to the load and generally straight across the
thickness, the fracture surface changes from quite smooth in the low stress level
tests to extremely rough at higher loads. The fracture surfaces become so rough that
adequate replication has proved very difficult.

                                         ANALYSIS
Data reduction
    Crack growth rates were calculated from a ‘least squares fit’ of the crack growth
data using an orthogonal polynomial method. A two degree polynomial fit the data
very well in all cases. The equation for N:

                                    N=A+BL+CL”.                                        (2)

   where: A, B, C = constants
can be differentiated to give:

                                       dL
                                       -=         1
                                                                                       (3)
                                       dN     Bt2CL’

A two degree fit was accurate for the load curve in the extension-controlled       test as
well. These polynomial expressions were used in all subsequent correlations.

Stress intensity factor correlation
    To try to correlate the crack growth data, the most obvious parameter was the
stress intensity factor range, AK, mentioned in the Introduction.  For the center-
notched plate, the formula used for K was:

                                                       7TL
                                    K = q,
                                             d   W tan 2~’                             (4)


where: o’, = gross section stress
       W = specimen width.

     Figure 9 shows the results of applying this parameter to the widest range of
data; the 40.000 psi and 60,000 psi tests, plus the extension-controlled        test using
the instantaneous    stress level. Note that the two load-controlled      curves tend to
deviate from straight lines on the log-log plot at high AK levels, as well as having
different values for the apparent material constant c in (1). The extension-controlled
data even go the wrong direction entirely, for the stress intensity range increases as the
crack growth rate decreases. Certainly a different parameter is needed.

Net section stress correlation
     The parameter that proved to correlate best with the data was the simplest possible,
the nominal crack tip stress. The nominal crack tip stress is defined as the stress at the
tip of the crack calculated considering the geometrical concentration caused by the
unloaded crack surfaces. but disregarding the infinite stresses caused by the mathemat-
ical singularity at the junction of the opposing crack surfaces. Since the test specimen
is loaded in uniform tension. the nominal crack tip stress is simply the stress on the net
section remaining as the crack progresses:

                                                 a,W
                                             =

                                                   dN   c c W-L 1 .

Note the similarity between (3) and (6) if c is a negative constant. The result of applying
(6) is shown in Fig. 10. The agreement is very good, with the calculated points clustered
about the average line with its slope of 3.25, which is the value of n in (6). The data from
each separate test also have approximately the same slope. This is a requirement if the
crack growth equation developed is ever to predict an L vs. N plot at a given load level.
    The lack of success in applying the stress intensity factor is not surprising. Since it
is based on a purely elastic peak stress distribution, it really has little chance of working
in tests of a ductile material at high temperature. It is perhaps surprising that the crack
growth rate is related simply to a nominal crack tip stress. Surely one would expect
many complicating effects of size, shape, and intensity of the crack tip plastic zone in a
strain softening material. A severe test of this parameter would be to apply it to
published data at different test conditions.

Crooker and Lange data
     The low-cycle fatigue crack growth data published by Crooker and Lange in [ 111
is probably different enough from the present test series to test the applicability of the
nominal crack tip stress. These tests were performed on high strength 9Ni-4Co-0-02X
steel (clUS= 180,000 psi) in air at room temperature. Instead of a center-notched tensile
specimen, an edge-notched cantilever bend specimen was used (Fig. 11). All tests were
run with a constant stress range, but with a varying mean stress. There was no compres-
sive loading employed. Their crack growth data are shown in Fig. 12.
     The appropriate stress intensity factor was used to correlate the data as shown in
Fig. I 3. The data for different tests are layered on the graph, and the slopes of individual
datasets varies from that of the whole. Crooker and Lange attributed these character-
istics to the different mean stresses involved, and used the equations of Forman et uf.
[93, and Roberts and Erdogan[lO], to adjust for their effects. This reduced the scatter
somewhat, but did not eliminate the layering.
     The crack-tip stress in this case is not an average net section stress, as the net
section is in bending. Instead, the simple beam equation can be used:

    Here the crack length term is squared, where in the center-notched specimen v.IFET
varied linearly with the crack length. With this crack growth data, a four degree poly-
nomial fit was needed, instead of the two degree used before. The result of applying
(T.%rET
      is shown in Fig. 14. These data points are well clustered. There is very little
layering of the tests. And the slopes of individual tests closely match the over-all slope
of 3.21. No reason is given for the similar slope of these data to that of the high-
temperature data presented in this paper.
    The use of the nominal crack-tip stress proved valuable in analyzing these data.
Another source of abundant low-cycle fatigue crack propagation data is the Brothers
and Yukawa paper [ 121.

Brothers   and Yukawa data
     These authors published quite good correlations of room temperature low-cycle
fatigue crack growth data with the stress intensity factor. They found that for the low
alloy steels tested (NiCrMoV and CrMoV), the slope of the crack growth rate curves
varied from Paris’ [8] 4, and seemed to be a function of yield strength level. One of

 15. (The two highest stress level curves are unpublished data obtained from the authors).
The data of Fig. 16 are shown as published, and the points are not referred to specific
test stress levels. No attempt was made to check the data reduction techniques used.
Figure 17 shows the results of using the net section stress for these center-notched
plate specimens. Here the correlation is not nearly as good as in the other data analyzed.
There is layering of the data, and the individual data sets have higher slopes, although
they are still all straight lines. The straight lines seem to indicate that the net section
stress adequately defines the effect of crack length, but the c of (6) used must include
an additional effect of (T,.

Static   crack grcjwth tests
    The General Electric Turbine Department has recently been investigating a very
different type of crack growth: static crack growth under monotonic creep rupture at
1000 F [ 141. The material is CrMoV steel taken from a steam turbine rotor after 72,000
hr service. The chemical composition is shown in Table 3.
    Its mechanical properties at the time of fatigue testing are listed in Table 4.
    The reduction in area after a 156.3 hr rupture test at 1050 F was 13 per cent.
     Crack growth curves from center-notched        plate specimens are shown in Fig. 18.
A correlation of the data was made using the stress intensity factor (Fig. 19). Although
there is little reason why K should be applied to this case, the results did not look

unreasonable. But when the net section stress was used, the results were outstanding
(Fig. 20). All the data are tightly grouped in a straight line. The slope of the line is steep
indicating that the crack growth is extremely sensitive to stress level under these
conditions.

                                      DISCUSSION
    A number of questions are raised by the Results and Analysis presented here. Why
can a nominal crack tip stress correlate data so well in low-cycle fatigue at high and
low temperatures, and even in monotonic creep rupture? How can this stress have any
real significance in the face of the many, many tests that have correlated well with the

stress intensity factor? If the nominal crack tip stress is an essential parameter, what
effect will it have on actual component analysis?
    The reasons for the success of the nominal crack tip stress do not appear obvious.
One can conjecture that perhaps the plastic flow near the crack tip in a low-temperature
test and the stress relaxation and creep damage there in a high-temperature test are
fundamentally related to the underlying stress field. Certainly, however, in these
applications the reasons are no more obvious why the elastic stress intensity factor has
worked. Perhaps the situation is analogous to comparing smooth and notched rupture
data; only the most brittle materials are notch sensitive in short-time tests. If a material
behaves in a brittle fashion, then the elastically calculated peak stress is most likely
the critical parameter. If it acts ductile, a nominal stress should be used.
    Perhaps one reason why the crack tip stress has not been applied in more tests is
that in more complicated test specimens than those discussed here, difficult stress
analysis is required. Where non-uniform or point loadings are applied, strength-of-
material solutions may not be adequate and elasticity analysis will be required. The
mathematical problems at the crack tip can be ignored, but a fair job must still be done
on the general stress field.
    The most serious implications of this stress parameter arise in component applica-
tions. If one is to believe that the nominal crack tip stress is the critical variable, then
the significance of the crack length changes completely. If its effect is only to change the

crack   tip stress in a test specimen, then will it have any effect in a large component
where it cannot unload the stress field? For a case where the stress intensity factor
approach would predict an accelerating crack growth rate, the crack tip stress approach
would perhaps predict a constant one. Thus much more care must be taken in specimen
design to separate these effects of crack length.
    The tests presented here are continuing. Tests are planned to investigate the effects
of compressive loading, thickness, strain cycling, and hold time. A specimen will be
designed to better assess the effect of crack length. Fractographic studies will continue
in the hope of learning more about the fracture process involved. And efforts will
continue in applying this method to other published fatigue crack growth data.
    There has been no intent at suggesting that this crack tip stress is a universal para-
meter that will replace the stress intensity factor in all cases. Instead. several interesting
correlations have been presented in the hope that other investigators will compare them
to their approaches. However, to continue to use the stress intensity factor, or any
other variable. without anaiy~ing the way each and every test contributes to the whole,
and without taking a resulting crack growth law and testing its ability to predict indi-
vidual tests, can result in serious misapplications of test data to component design.

                                       CONCLUSIONS
    f 1) Limited load-controIled tension cycling data on CrMoV in low cycle fatigue at
IO00 F show excellent correlation of crack growth rate with a parameter based on the
nominal crack tip stress.
    (2) The same parameter also shows good agreement with several samples of data
on low-temperature,      low-cycle fatigue and monotonic creep rupture crack growth
where use of the stress intensity factor had given only limited correlation.
    (3) In high-temperature low-cycle fatigue of CrMoV, prior cycling at lower stress
fevels causes little history effect, but prior cycling at higher stress levels greatly retards
crack growth.
    (4) These correlations discussed raise serious questions regarding the use of the
stress intensity factor in correlating fatigue crack growth data.
