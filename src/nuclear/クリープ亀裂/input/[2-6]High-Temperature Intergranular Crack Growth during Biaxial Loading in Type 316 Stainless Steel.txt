                Effects of the biaxial tensile state of stress on the crack growth                            behaviour,      and   the local deformation
        and     cavitation    near the crack        tip were     studied      during       straining     of type 316       stainless steel by          tension     at
        923K      and   a strain   rate   of 4×10‑6s‑1.        The    crack      growth      rate   reached      a constant      value    after   an    initial ac‑

        celeration for a given loading condition, and the steady state crack growth rate increased noticeably with
        increasing degree of biaxial state of stress. Under a higher degree of stress biaxiality, a more developed
        work-hardened    state due to a higher strain rate, and more frequent cavitation were found to occur in a
        crack    tip region    (several     100μm     in size)    where    the     stress    (and   strain)     was   concentrated.         Further,      the    size

         of this crack tip region itself tended to become smaller. The increase in the steady state crack growth rate
         with increasing stress biaxiality was able to be explained phenomenologically     from these findings on the
        local deformation     and cavitation ahead of the crack.

stress in a specimen         which has been clamped
under tension becomes higher by simultaneous
application     of tensile stress along the direction
normal     to the tensile axis, i.e. under a biaxial
state of stress. The situation         may be the same
after nonelastic      tensile deformation         and even
during    deformation       at a constant      strain rate.
Further,    this may hold even at the tip of crack
which exists normal to the tensile axis. Natural-
ly, such a higher tensile stress at the crack tip
may lead to a more developed             work-hardened
state there.     Moreover,       a calculation      using a
finite element method on an elasto-plastic              solid
has shown that an area at the crack tip, where
the stress level exceeds the yield stress and the
plastic flow occurs, becomes    smaller with in-
creasing degree of biaxial state of stress(17)(18).
Regarding the cavitation, on the other hand, it
has been deduced from theoretical arguments
that cavity nucleation and growth rates may
increase as the multiaxiality of stress in-
creases(19)(20).
              All the predictions mentioned above
certainly suggest a higher rate of crack growth
under a biaxial (or multiaxial) tensile state of
stress, compared with uniaxial stressing.
   In the present work, effects of stress biaxiali-
ty on the behaviour of high-temperature
intergranular crack growth was studied ex-
perimentally in type. 316 stainless steel. Fur-
ther, local deformation and cavitation near the
tips of cracks which had grown under varied
biaxial tensile states of stress were examined.
The objective of this work is to investigate
whether and how, compared with uniaxial
stressing, the crack growth is accelerated under
a biaxial tensile state of stress. To make clear

be reasonable               to presume                that,        in the first              ap-
proximation,               σx may         increase            linearly            with       Fx.
Hence, in the present work, a value of Fx itself
will be used as a measure for a biaxial state of
stress.
   Both the time needed for the crack genera-
tion at the notch root and the subsequent crack
growth behaviour                      at a very early stage (crack
length a<〜0.2mm)                                showed              some               scatter

from specimen to specimen,     due presumably   to
inaccuracy  of the initial notch shape. Figure 3
shows the variation   of carck length a with time
tin     later     stages        (a≧0.2mm).                   For      each        value         of

Fx, the crack length    tends   to increase    first
slowly and then rapidly    at a constant  rate for
a>〜0.8mm;                       the   crack         growth          rate       reaches           a

constant value in the steady state after an ini-
tial acceleration. Similar findings of steady
state crack growth under constant strain-rate
conditions have also been reported in Cu-1
mass%Sb(13)and Discalloy(2). It is clearly seen
from the figure that the crack growth rate
da/dt in the steady state increases with in-
creasing Fx, i.e. with increasing degree of stress
biaxiality.

on the crack length in the steady state. This
fact may imply that the distribution       of strain

crack tip has been reported      previously in type

at     the     crack        tip,    dεy/dt       is   much        higher      for

Fx=574N              than for Fx=0N.

   Information  on cavitation may be obtained
from Fig. 6(a) and (b), which are optical
micrographs showing a crack tip area for Fx=0
and 574N, respectively. The principal findings
from these photographs      may be presented as
follows:
