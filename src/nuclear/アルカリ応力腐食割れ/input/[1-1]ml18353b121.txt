                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report summarizes the available domestic and international operating experience (OpE) for
both power and research advanced non-light-water reactors with regard to materials and
component integrity. It focuses on both sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) and
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs). The OpE among salt reactors is limited (i.e., 4
years at the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (1965–1969)).
The available information on this experiment was captured in “Technical Gap Assessment for
Materials and Component Integrity Issues for Molten Salt Reactors” (Agencywide Documents
Access and Management System Accession No. ML19077A137).

This report identifies OpE relevant to the following:

•      materials used, including a summary of the range of materials used in both SFRs and
       HTGRs

•      observed and anticipated material degradation mechanisms for both SFRs and HTGRs

•      component integrity issues

•      possible solutions to challenges involving materials and component integrity

•      specific issues based on OpE that should be addressed in the development of regulatory
       infrastructure

•      assessment tools and evaluation techniques (e.g., nondestructive evaluation (NDE))
       used to identify and address component integrity issues

This effort identifies OpE in SFRs, HTGRs, and related test loops to aid the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission’s preparations for licensing SFRs and HTGRs. The components of
interest include, but are not limited to, primary and secondary piping, steam generator (SG)
components, pumps, and reactor pressure vessels (RPVs). Future companion reports will
identify gaps in consensus codes and standards and computational codes used in the
construction and operation of SFRs and HTGRs.

This report makes the following significant findings related to SFRs:

•      The Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) never experienced a sodium/water
       reaction because the EBR-II was designed with double-walled (concentric tubes brazed
       or swaged together) SG tubes. Other SFRs that did not use double-walled SG tubes
       experienced sodium/water reactions.

•      Corrosion of immersed stainless steel (SS) components in sodium is not a concern if
       sodium purity is maintained. No significant corrosion of materials in the sodium circuits
       of the BN-10 reactor occurred during 44 years of operation; therefore, a 60 year life of
       piping circuits and future SFR designs is possible.

•      Weld design and quality control are critically important. Residual weld stresses, excess
       weld metal, and weld constraints should be minimized, and direct tube-to-tube-plate
       welds should be avoided entirely in SFRs. Lowering the threshold for quality in welds
       and secondary loops has resulted in operational problems.
•      Reheat cracking is a concern in SFR components operating at high temperatures. In
       particular, weld repairs should be carefully managed because they may give rise to very
       high tensile residual stresses. Some types of austenitic SS (e.g., American Iron and
       Steel Institute (AISI) 321 SS) are significantly more prone to reheat cracking than other
       austenitic SS.

•      Stresses induced by thermal expansion, particularly in areas of constraint, must be
       carefully considered. The stresses have often been the source of structural integrity
       issues in SFR operation.

•      Thermal fatigue (thermal striping) caused by mixing sodium flows at different
       temperatures is a significant issue in SFRs.

•      Management of the startup and cooldown transients in SFRs to control vibration, thermal
       expansion loads, and possible fatigue issues are important.

•      Shrink-fit parts should be avoided because they could loosen during thermal transients.

•      Electromagnetic pumps have operated reliably.

•      Oil-based lubricants should be avoided in SFRs.

•      Possible valve failures (for all system valves, especially those operating at high
       temperature) are a concern for SFRs. Valve reliability under operating conditions should
       be determined accurately.

•      Austenitic steels are unsuitable for SFR SGs because of the potential for caustic
       stress-corrosion damage following even small leaks.

•      Testing should confirm the chemical compatibility between molten sodium and insulation
       material.

•      Secondary measurement devices (e.g., thermocouples) must be properly designed to
       prevent leaks. Flow-induced vibrations and complex fluid flows in these areas can
       cause failure and sodium leaks.

•      Accurate detection methods of corrosion and leaks are necessary, particularly in regions
       coated with insulation. The design phase should consider sensor placement and
       reliability under operating conditions. Inadequate or unreliable leak detection systems
       have resulted in extensive shutdowns caused by sodium contamination and excessive
       sodium leaks with consequent fires.

•      The licensing process needs to scrutinize seismic and external dynamic loading events
       of SFRs. During an emergency shutdown (scram), the intermediate heat exchanger
       may experience thermal shock caused by the influx of cold sodium. This could lead to
       buckling and structural issues amplified by an external loading.

The report makes the following significant findings related to HTGRs:

•      The accurate prediction of core temperatures in HTGRs is problematic. Even for more
       recent designs (e.g., the high-temperature test reactor), core temperatures have
       exceeded anticipated design temperatures.


                                               ii
•   Moisture ingress and leakage events are a reoccurring problem with HTGRs. HTGRs
    should be designed to accommodate and mitigate moisture ingress.

•   Failures within the SG could introduce water into the primary loop and introduce the
    potential for unanticipated reactivity.

•   Management of thermal stresses is important in HTGRs because thermal expansion
    stresses can cause large loads and creep.

•   The design of HTGRs must consider the accumulation of cycles during testing. Failure
    to account for these additional cycles led to fatigue failures in both Peach Bottom Atomic
    Power Station and Germany’s Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor.

•   Pumps, seals, and compressors have a history of poor reliability in HTGRs. The design
    and testing of these components should be well scrutinized.

•   HTGRs should be designed to minimize sources of graphite dust (e.g., fretting) and
    should include filters or other mitigating measures to address graphite dust.

•   Coarse-grained alloys are used for improved creep resistance; however, they are more
    vulnerable to cracking. Control of alloy grain sizes should be considered because alloys
    with excessive grain size may have insufficient toughness.

•   Oil-based lubricants should be avoided in HTGRs.

•   HTGRs need to ensure the structural integrity of the RPVs and the connecting vessels,
    especially under low helium flow and loss-of-forced convection conditions because
    buckling may occur.

•   Backup systems must be properly designed to handle overloads and system upsets
    such as seismic loads.

1. INTRODUCTION
Several advanced non-light-water reactor (ANLWR) concepts are being considered at this time,
including, among others, the following:

•      very-high-temperature reactors (with outlet temperatures of 900–1,000 degrees Celsius
       (C)) (1,652–1,832 degrees Fahrenheit (F))

•      sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) (500–600 degrees C) (932–1,112 degrees F),
       including the traveling wave reactor

•      supercritical water reactors (510–625 degrees C) (950 degrees–1,107 degrees F)

•      high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) (700–800 degrees C) (1,292–1,472
       degrees F)

•      lead-cooled fast reactors (480–570 degrees C) (896–1,058 degrees F)

•      molten salt reactors (MSRs) (600–800 degrees C) (1,112–1,472 degrees F)

Recent workshops presented by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) discussed the regulatory challenges and needs related to
these ANLWRs [1], [2], [3].

This effort is concerned with examining domestic and international operating experience (OpE),
technical gaps, consensus codes and standards, and computational codes for SFRs and
HTGRs. This report did not include OpE on MSRs because of the general lack of OpE. Only
one MSR, the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
operated for 4 years (1965–1969) [4]. The available information on this experiment was
captured in “Technical Gap Assessment for Materials and Component Integrity Issues for
Molten Salt Reactors” (Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS)
Accession No. ML19077A137) [5]. This report focuses on OpE with materials and component
integrity.

NUREG/CR-6944, “Next Generation Nuclear Plant Phenomena Identification and Ranking
Tables (PIRTs): High-Temperature Materials PIRTs,” Volume 4, issued March 2008 [6], ranks
the most significant phenomena associated with HTGRs with regard to thermohydraulics, fission
products transport, structural graphite, irradiation effects on materials, material stability at
elevated temperatures, weld residual stress relaxation section damage, environmental
degradation, and fabrication issues, including the properties of heavy section steel used for
reactor pressure vessels (RPVs).

NUREG/KM-0007, “NRC Program on Knowledge Management for Liquid-Metal-Cooled
Reactors,” issued April 2014 [7] (and references cited therein), summarizes knowledge
management efforts to develop and compile information on liquid-metal-cooled reactors (LMRs),
including issues with the materials in SFRs. NUREG/KM-0007 documents NRC licensing
activities and safety analyses associated with U.S. reactors along with international reactors.
Appendix A, “List of Documents in the NRC Knowledge Center,” to NUREG/KM-0007 lists many
available references. These include information and documentation on LMR severe accidents,
operational issues, and analysis tools relevant for licensing purposes.

This effort identifies OpE in SFRs, HTGRs, and related test loops to aid the NRC’s preparations
for licensing SFRs and HTGRs. References [6] and [7] summarize the expected materials for
different components. The components of interest include, but are not limited to, primary and
secondary piping, steam generator (SG) components, pumps, and RPVs. This compendium will
also be used to inform future work on consensus codes and standards and computational codes
used in the construction and operation of SFRs and HTGRs.

2. OVERVIEW
2.1       Background Summary

Multiple domestic and international corporations have stated their intent to conduct prelicensing
or licensing activities for ANLWRs with the NRC in the next 5 years. The NRC is seeking to
develop additional technical capabilities and update its regulatory infrastructure to license new,
innovative ANLWRs in an efficient and effective manner. This report summarizes OpE for
domestic and international power and research SFRs and HTGRs. Material and structural
degradation issues are the main interest; however, the report also describes nondestructive
evaluation (NDE) experience. This document summarizes OpE from publicly available
documents. The NRC will use OpE to identify gaps in technology necessary to expand
consensus codes and standards (e.g., American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)) and
modify or develop computational codes for assessing damage mechanisms of ANLWRs.

This report identifies and compiles service experience and potential issues, including damage
development mechanisms and anticipated issues of concern for the NRC licensing of future
ANLWRs. It is possible some prior experience with older reactors may not apply to anticipated
ANLWR designs. This report also identifies additional issues, to the maximum extent possible,
such as crack and damage detection OpE.

Component integrity issues identified for SFRs and HTGRs include:

      •   sodium/helium leakage, including leakage at seals and pumps

      •   thermal shock and thermal mismatch

      •   seismic responsive structures

      •   creep damage and crack growth

      •   low cycle fatigue

      •   void swelling

2.2       Scope of Advanced Non-Light-Water Reactor Operational Experience

For both SFRs and HTGRs, this report obtained and discussed the following OpE:

•         materials used in SFRs and HTGRs, including metals, nonmetals (e.g., graphite,
          ceramic components, and concrete), and protective coatings

•         observed and anticipated material degradation mechanisms for both SFRs and HTGRs




                                                2
•      component integrity issues, including operational damage (e.g., metal creep, cracking,
       fracture, swelling, concrete degradation, SG leakage and plugging, and weld cracking)

•      possible solutions to materials and component integrity challenges, including inservice
       evaluation and repair

•      specific issues based on OpE that should be addressed in developing the regulatory
       infrastructure

•      evaluation techniques (e.g., NDE) used to identify and address component integrity
       issues unique to these ANLWR technologies

2.3   Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors

Concerns related to SFRs include a focus on preventing leaks of molten sodium coolant
because sodium is reactive in the presence of air and water. The potential for thermal shock,
thermal mismatch stresses, and seismic response are of particular importance in SFRs. Some
SFR designs must manage low-cycle fatigue and creep damage, depending on operating
conditions and materials. Furthermore, SFRs have experienced leaks and pump failures at
seals. Finally, the secondary sodium loop in SFRs operates at near atmospheric pressure and
the steam system operates at high pressure. These significant pressure differentials combined
with the reactivity of sodium make it critical to prevent SG tube failures [8]. Guidez et al. [9]
discussed issues with the possible interaction of water and sodium in SFR SGs. In these
events, pressurized water reacts with sodium in a highly exothermic way, causing a high-speed
water/sodium jet to damage nearby structures and produce a corrosive byproduct (sodium
hydroxide). If the water leakage rate is large, the tube may swell and subsequently burst. For
example, during startup of Phénix [10], excess weld metal at butt welds caused stress
concentrations, which led to tube cracking and sodium/water interactions. Sodium/water
interactions produce sodium hydroxide and hydrogen, which can be detected to shut down the
reactor, if needed. In general, SGs have not been reliable, and sodium heat transport systems
have leaked at welds.

Material performance requirements for SFRs differ from those for light-water reactors (LWRs) as
follows:

•      Typical operating pressures within the sodium coolant areas are low (near atmospheric
       pressure), although differential pressures between the secondary sodium and the
       water/steam side of the SGs are higher in SFRs than those seen between the primary
       and secondary water loops in LWRs.

•      Thermal loads are more important. These loads are induced by the high thermal
       conductivity of sodium combined with high temperatures and temperature fluctuations
       (thermal shock) and complex fluid flows in some areas. Thermal properties of the
       materials must be chosen with this in mind.

•      During normal operating conditions, temperatures usually range between
       200–560 degrees C (392–1,040 degrees F) and are higher during transients. The lower
       temperatures occur during startup. This requires materials to retain adequate toughness
       after experiencing creep damage.

•      Irradiation effects on structural materials outside the core are less significant.



                                                 3
•      Materials must be compatible with sodium and contaminants (e.g., sodium hydroxides).

Material considerations include, among others, sensitivity to material creep, creep fatigue,
thermal aging, and performance in sodium. The system must maintain ductility over the life of
the plant in case of accidental loadings and material aging, which has affected LWRs. Grades
of 304 and 316 stainless steel (SS) maintained good creep and corrosion resistance with high
toughness along with Alloy 800 for SG parts, as discussed by Guidez et al. [9]. In addition,
three major incidents (discussed later) led to shutdowns another 19 percent of the time.

2.4 High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors

Despite the larger potential for high-temperature damage mechanisms compared to SFRs or
LWRs, the majority of significant OpE at HTGRs appears to be related to the contamination of
the primary loop by either moisture, lubricants, or excessive graphite dust or the performance of
seals and compressors. In general, design flaws in HTGRs unrelated to fabrication led to
conditions resulting in material and component failures. The materials used in HTGRs include
SA-508/SA-533 steel for lower temperature RPVs and for LWR vessels and modified 9Cr-1Mo
(Grade 91) steel for higher temperature RPVs. Alloy 800 has been chosen for some HTGR
SGs. McDowell et al. [11] discusses materials used in HTGRs.

Materials performance requirements for HTGRs are markedly different from those for LWRs as
follows:

•      Creep resistance is critically important because of the higher operating temperatures
       (700–950 degrees C) (1,292–1,752 degrees F) of HTGRs. The requirement for creep
       resistance of the RPV material is design specific because HTGR designs typically cool
       the RPV with helium from the cold leg.

•      HTGRs have a high-temperature strength that allows them to resist buckling during low
       healing flow or loss-of-forced convection conditions.

•      HTGRs are resistant to high-temperature decarburization (primary loop).

•      HTGRs are resistant to corrosion from high-temperature water and steam (steam loop).

HTGR graphite has a number of separate requirements, including isotropic or near isotropic
properties and a high degree of resistance to irradiation damage. The performance
requirements of structural materials, including graphite, are principally dictated by HTGR
operating temperatures, which in some cases have been markedly higher than temperatures
predicted by design analyses.

This report examined the information obtained (e.g., reports, conversations) to identify the
important OpE issues of concern for materials and structures in ANLWRs summarized in the
OpE list for HTGRs below.

2.5 Relation to Advanced Non-Light-Water Reactor Licensing

The results in this report will identify the OpE expected in HTGRs and SFRs and corresponding
damage development mechanisms. However, some OpE may not apply to new ANLWRs. This
report will also identify additional issues for consideration by the NRC to the maximum extent
possible. The results may specifically help identify necessary changes to the regulatory


                                                4
licensing framework supporting ANLWR licensing (e.g., changes to Section 3.6.3,
“Leak-Before-Break Evaluation Procedures,” of NUREG-0800, “Standard Review Plan for the

Sodium supports a fast neutron spectrum because it has low neutron moderation and
absorption. The large margin to boiling of sodium (about 700 degrees C) (1,292 degrees F)
allows for efficient operation at atmospheric pressure [7]. Sodium is also chemically compatible
with structural materials, which minimizes corrosion in plant cooling systems. However, an inert
atmosphere covering the sodium is needed because sodium is reactive with air and water.
Molten sodium will burn if it is exposed to air or water; therefore, special fire-suppression
systems are an important part of the design. The reactivity of sodium led to many of the issues
described below.



                                                5
3.1   Fuel Structure and Cladding, Subassemblies, and Core Components

(1)   (Phénix, 1979): Cladding failure in a fuel pin [10] resulted in the largest fission gas
      (xenon-135) release at the Phénix plant. Cracking of the Type 316 SS cladding in a
      faulty fuel subassembly caused the release of the fission gas. Initial fabrication defects
      during construction must be identified.

(2)   (Phénix, early operation): Sodium- and irradiation-induced swelling in heat-treated
      Type 316 SS was more pronounced than expected. During the first years of Phénix’s
      operation, the behavior of the pin bundle with spacing wires under irradiation was a
      major problem that limited the lifetime of the plant’s subassemblies as damage
      developed from fretting caused by thermal expansion. The most significant
      deformations included cladding swelling, helical twisting of the pins, and localized
      bulging of the hexagonal tube surface at the wire pitch by mechanical interaction with the
      bundles. To remedy this situation, the hexagonal guide sheaths were made slightly
      shorter 5 millimeters (mm) (0.2 in.) to better manage inservice distortion induced by
      swelling of the fuel pins [10]. The SS used in the hexagonal fuel wrapper was replaced
      with titanium-stabilized and -hardened SS, which greatly reduced swelling (the exact
      grade was not specified). Irradiation-induced embrittlement, swelling, and distortion
      must be accounted for properly.

(3)   (Phénix, early operation): A serious fuel pin failure during dismantling of the hexagonal
      wrapper occurred because of irradiation-induced ductility reduction in the Type 316 SS
      hexagonal wrapper. The dismantling process involved sawing and tearing off metal from
      two sides [10], leading to a rupture. Modifications were made to the cutting and milling
      process to avoid such ruptures in future dismantling operations. The proper choice of
      materials for SFRs requires complete material databases, which should account for
      irradiation embrittlement, swelling, and distortion.

(4)   (Phénix, general): Fifteen out of more than 140,000 fuel pins leaked over the lifetime of
      the Phénix reactor. In case of cladding failure, a slow reaction proceeds between the
      oxide fuel and sodium, forming a lower density sodium oxide compound. This induced
      swelling leads to cracking and failure of the cladding. Therefore, it is very important to
      detect the failure as soon as possible and to unload the defective fuel assembly.
      Spectroscopic and chromatographic monitoring of the primary sodium cover gas was the
      basis for the Phénix clad failure detection and localization system. Cladding failures
      resulted in shutdowns of 3 days, which is the time required to replace the defective fuel
      subassembly [10]. In most cases of cladding failure, the reactor was stopped before it
      reached an automatic trip threshold. Reliable sensors for detecting fission gas release
      are necessary.

(5)   (BN-350, general): The primary issue for fuel assembly design in Russian reactors was
      the swelling of steel under high neutron fluences. Radiation exposure of SS OH18N10T
      (similar to AISI Type 321 SS) used in the fuel rod structure resulted in differential
      swelling, high local stresses, and cracking. Irradiation testing on structural materials
      during the BN-350 project development was minimal which led, in part, to problems with
      the fuel assemblies. An extensive program had to be developed, and multiple types of
      steels were investigated to determine the effects of irradiation swelling, embrittlement,
      and creep characteristics to select the optimum steels for fuel element cladding, ЧС-68
      (the Russian equivalent to cold-worked titanium stabilized Type 316 SS), and ferritic-
      martensitic steel EP-450. The design of the BN-350 was also modified to account for



                                               6
       this issue [13]. Proper selection of materials for SFRs requires complete material
       databases, which should account for irradiation embrittlement, swelling, and distortion.

(6)    (BN-600, 1983–1987): Because of multiple instances of fuel pin failures, the Russian
       BN-600 reactor was shut down six times for unplanned refuelling [14,15]. The
       investigations of the failed fuel revealed stress-induced corrosion of the annealed
       (Russian-grade) austenitic steel claddings as one of the main causes of their early
       failures. The claddings were damaged mainly in the peripheral region of the core
       because the periphery had the most unfavourable operating conditions (highest fluence)
       in the core. Because the fuel pins were reshuffled and rotated during operation, their
       linear heat rating and cladding temperature rose up to 54 kilowatts per minute and
       710 degrees C (1,310 degrees F), respectively, at the end of the fuel cycle (favourable
       operating conditions were not specified). An improved (unspecified) cladding alloy
       eliminated the problems. The proper choice of materials for SFRs requires complete
       material databases, which should account for irradiation embrittlement, swelling, and
       distortion.

(7)    (Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF), early operation): Although the FFTF fuel performed
       extremely well (low outage time), one driver fuel pin and several test pins experienced
       cladding breaches during the more than 10 years of reactor operation [16]. These
       breaches released relatively small amounts of radioactive cesium into the primary
       sodium and cover gas systems, which led to operational complications. A cesium trap
       was installed in the FFTF primary sodium processing system in 1987, following nearly
       7 years of operation that included several fuel pin failure events. The cesium trap
       mitigated contamination of the primary loop. SFR designs should account for fuel
       failure.

(8)    (FFTF, general): Reflector assemblies were made of Alloy 600 and experienced
       swelling behaviour caused by the neutron flux in the FFTF [17]. This was a poor choice
       of material, resulting from a design that used insufficient test data to describe the
       swelling response of Alloy 600. Proper choice of materials for SFRs requires complete
       materials databases, which should account for irradiation embrittlement, swelling and
       distortion.

(9)    (Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR), May 1987): India’s FBTR experienced a problem
       as a fuel subassembly was being transferred from the core to the periphery [18]. The
       improper design of the fuel transport system caused extensive bending of the
       subassembly and the heads of the reflector subassemblies during transport. Details
       were not specified; however, the transport system was improved, and it was noted that
       this was an expensive solution.

(10)   (Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR), general): Neutron-induced distortion of core
       components in the United Kingdom’s PFR and its effect on plant operation is a similar
       issue to some of the problems discussed above. Radiation damage resulting from the
       high neutron fluxes and operating temperatures of a fast reactor can give rise to
       dimensional changes in core components. The mechanisms involved are swelling
       caused by neutron-induced voids (NIV) and radiation creep. Large differences in NIV
       swelling rates occurred in different batches of the same material because of a quality
       control problem that was not adequately addressed and thus led to handling problems of
       components made of cold-worked EN58B. The materials chosen later in the lifetime of
       the PFR, such as Nimonic Alloy PE 16, had considerably lower swelling rates.



                                               7
       Components manufactured from the ferritic steel FV448, which was undergoing testing
       at the time of the PFR’s closure, had extremely low swelling rates. NIV distortion was
       not expected to be life limiting for this material [19]. The proper choice of materials for
       SFRs requires complete material databases, which should account for irradiation
       embrittlement, swelling, and distortion.

(11)   (BN-600, 1995): The central rotating column (CRC) in BN-600 is used for refuelling the
       core. In 1995, an increase in force required to turn the CRC was observed. The CRC
       rotates during fuel assembly and fuel reloading operations. During examination of the
       problem, sodium found in the bearing assembly was impeding the CRC turning motion.
       This phenomenon was caused by the transfer of sodium vapor from the reactor cover
       gas (argon) through the gap between the CRC and rotation plug and the subsequent
       accumulation of sodium and its compositions in the bearing assembly. Designs should
       consider the potential for sodium vapor penetration and condensation.

(12)   (FFTF, general): The FFTF outer row assemblies consisted of a stack of Inconel-600
       blocks penetrated by SS coolant tubes. These assemblies acted as a radial neutron
       reflector and as a straight, but flexible, core boundary. During design, these assemblies
       were assumed to exhibit low-swelling behaviour in a neutron flux based on a collection
       of high nickel-alloy data available at the inception of FFTF. However, during an FFTF
       refuelling outage, the degree of difficulty withdrawing an outer row driver fuel assembly
       was a function of the peak fast fluency of neighbouring reflector assemblies. Post-
       irradiation examinations showed that the reflector assemblies were both bowed and stiff.
       Differential swelling in a steep radial flux gradient [16, 17] had distorted the Inconel 600
       blocks into a trapezoidal cross-section. SFR designers must calculate fluxes accurately
       to minimize irradiation damage.

3.2    Reactor and Pumps

(1)    (Phénix, 1976): The primary coolant pump in Phénix experienced excessive vibrations
       [10, page 39]. As a result, operators decreased the pump speed until the pump could be
       extracted several months later. During inspection of the pump, a hydrostatic bearing
       that was shrunk-fit to the pump shaft during fabrication expanded during a severe
       thermal transient (automatic shutdown) and slipped down the pump shaft, damaging the
       shaft and also causing excessive vibrations. The Superphénix design eliminated
       shrink-fit fabrications to avoid this possible problem. Shrink-fit parts should be avoided
       in pumps that could loosen during thermal transients.

(2)    (Phénix, 1974–1975): Three separate secondary coolant leaks were traced to joining
       welds on large-diameter butterfly valves upstream from the SG. These leaks led to
       small fires in the insulation as a result of sodium reacting with air. Weld repairs were
       found to be ineffective, but replacement of the valves with diaphragms solved the
       problem. Possible valve failures remain a concern in all SFR designs [10].

(3)    (Superphénix, early operation): During Superphénix startup trials [9, Chapter 3],
       excessive vibration of the reactor internal structures was observed as soon as the
       primary pumps were started. This was a problem of flow-induced self-excitation caused
       by the cooling rate that was of the same order of excitation as the flow rate pulsations.
       The vibration could have led to structural damage of the internals. Increasing the vessel
       cooling flow rate by 50 percent solved the problem. This OpE illustrates the importance




                                                 8
      of managing the startup and cooldown transients in SFRs to control vibration and
      possible fatigue issues in the components.

(4)   (Superphénix, general): The primary pumps in Superphénix were immersed in sodium
      and designed based on the Phénix experience. The primary pumps operated without
      incident the entire working life of Superphénix. Each pump was heavily instrumented
      with three vibration sensors, three shaft rotation speed sensors, multiple flow rate
      sensors, and 32 thermocouples [9]. These sensors ensured that the pump operated
      properly and that the bearings operated properly to prevent cavitation. The main parts of
      the pumps were made from Type 316 SS and the castings (impeller, lantern, and
      diffuser) were made from Z3 CN20-10 with no molybdenum (American Society for
      Testing and Materials (ASTM) equivalent CF-3M) because OpE with Phénix had
      demonstrated that the presence of molybdenum increased the risk of spinodal
      decomposition. All materials performed as designed. In addition, based on the Phénix
      operation, the pumps had no shrink-fit parts that could loosen during thermal transients.
      As discussed in OpE No. 5 below, a coupling failed in the primary pump; however, this
      was not considered a pump failure. This OpE illustrates the usefulness of building upon
      lessons learned from a prototype reactor.

(5)   (Superphénix, September 1993): A sodium coolant coupling in a primary pump broke
      [9]. The poor alignment of this coupling led to a significant wear at the failure site. All
      couplings were replaced and properly aligned. No pump coupling failures were
      observed afterward.

(6)   (BN-600, 1981–1985): The unstable operation of pump speed control systems caused
      unplanned power losses between 1981 and 1985 [15, 24]; this problem also led to
      additional fatigue cycles. Impacts from the pump electric motor on the pump housing
      caused failures in the pump electric motor coupling (leading to excessive distortions)
      from increased vibration and fatigue cracks in pump shafts. Using a better shaft and
      coupling and operating the pumps in a steady mode after attaining the desired level of
      reactor power prevented any failures of the reactor coolant pumps since 1985. Thermal
      fatigue or periodic operation outside of normal design parameters may greatly reduce
      the lifetime of reactor components.

(7)   (FFTF, early operation): Sodium systems operated for over 20 years, including more
      than 10 years of reactor power operation. During this time, only one sodium leak
      (approximately 284 liters (75 gallons (gal)) of primary sodium) occurred during a
      refueling outage from a small electromagnetic pump. A combination of freeze and thaw
      cycles caused a leak that led to localized deformation of the electromagnetic pump duct
      wall and to subsequent operation under cavitation conditions. This process eroded the
      pump duct wall at one of the deformations and caused it to eventually fail. Plant
      operating procedures were subsequently revised to tightly control pump freeze and thaw
      cycles and to prevent pump cavitation [17]. Thermal fatigue or periodic operation
      outside of normal design parameters may greatly reduce the lifetime of reactor
      components

(8)   (Superphénix, date not provided): A blade broke on the impeller in a secondary pump.
      The secondary pumps circulated sodium in the secondary heat exchangers and resided
      in expansion tanks. The failure did not lead to any significant issue. The cause of the
      failure is not publicly documented [9].




                                                9
(9)   (Superphénix, July 1990): Air leaked into the sodium coolant [9, 20] from a compressor.
      It took the operators approximately 1 month to identify and shut down the plant for repair
      and subsequent purification of the sodium. An argon branch connection leading to an
      argon-activity measurement chamber was fitted with a small compressor (with a
      diameter of a few centimeters (cm)). This branch was designed to send argon to the
      measurement chamber. The membrane between the air side and argon side tore, which
      led to the sodium contamination. The lengthy delay in identifying this issue was traced
      to the designers’ choice not to measure the chemical composition of the core cover gas.
      The designers believed air ingress was not plausible because the core cover argon gas
      was always relatively overpressurized towards the ambient air and the overpressure was
      being continuously monitored. As a result, contamination of the sodium went unnoticed
      for months [9]. The membrane material and the reason for the tear were not described
      [9, 17]. This example highlights the value of confirmatory surveillance.

3.3   Sodium Storage Tanks and Drums

(1)   (Superphénix, 1987): A leak occurred in the sodium storage drum (about a 24 cubic
      meter (848 cubic ft) volume of sodium). Examinations showed both through-wall and
      partial through-wall cracks were pervasive in the wall-to-base welds. The cracking
      (shown in Figure 1) was primarily in the heat-affected zone; however, some cracks
      extended into the weld metal. Hydrogen embrittlement, enhanced by weld residual
      stresses, 1 created the cracks.




         Figure 1 Storage drum cracking in Superphénix (from [9, Figure 17.9])

      The storage drums were fabricated from 15D3, which is a low alloy ferritic steel
      consisting of iron (98–99 percent), manganese (0.5–0.8 percent), molybdenum
      (0.25–0.35 percent), silicon (0.15–0.3 percent), and chromium (0.0–0.3 percent). Similar
      cracking was found with 15D3 during the construction of the SNR-300 2 reactor in Kalkar,
      Germany [9, Chapter 17]. This material was subsequently found unsuitable for SFRs
      because of hydrogen embrittlement issues. Improper material selection in combination
      with inadequate welding procedures was the cause of the hydrogen cracking.



1
      This is a particular problem in refinery operations.
2
      The SNR-300 reactor was a German SFR that was completed in 1985 but never
      operated.


                                              10
3.4   Secondary (Intermediate) Heat Exchanger

(1)   (Phénix, 1976): The intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) experienced two separate
      sodium leak events [10, page 41] followed by fires. The events were caused by cracking
      in the welds joining the weld on the metal plate that closed off the sodium outlet nozzle
      in the secondary system above the heat exchanger. The metal plate connected two long
      shells that operated at different temperatures, which led to thermal expansion stresses
      that subsequently caused the cracks. The solution was to replace the plate with a more
      flexible design to accommodate the thermal mismatch. In addition, a flow-mixing device
      was added to the sodium header to reduce the temperature differences between the
      shells. Thermal mismatch loads and mixing of different sodium flows must be properly
      considered.

(2)   (Phénix, June 1985): In June 1985, a small sodium leak occurred in the secondary heat
      exchanger pipe circuit at a thermocouple thimble weld [10]. The source of the leak was a
      through-wall fatigue crack driven by vibration excitations of the thermocouple caused by
      sodium flow. A similar issue led to a serious fire at the Monju Nuclear Power Plant
      (Monju) in Japan (see OpE No. (4) below). Secondary measurement devices
      (e.g., thermocouples) must be properly designed to prevent leaks. Flow-induced
      vibrations and complex fluid flows in these areas can cause failure and sodium leaks.

(3)   (Phénix, April 1990): A small sodium leak was detected at an auxiliary circuit tee pipe
      joint [10, Chapter 14]. An operator failed to completely close a valve. This error led to
      residual sodium flows, which created thermal fluctuations (thermal striping) that resulted
      in fatigue cracking. This is another example of a damage mechanism in SFRs driven by
      temperature gradients caused by sodium flow.

(4)   (Monju, December 1995): After a scheduled shutdown and the following plant startup
      [21], a sodium leak occurred in the secondary heat transport system of pipe loop C (a
      hot-leg geometry) and led to a serious fire when it interacted with oxygen and moisture.
      The leak melted steel structures in the room and resulted in a solidified sodium residue
      on the room floor almost 3 meter (m) (9 feet (ft)) in diameter and approximately 30 cm (1
      ft) deep. The leak was located at a 3 mm (0.12 inch (in.)) diameter thermocouple
      penetration (Figure 2). The failure of the thermocouple well tube released the well tip
      and permitted sodium to flow through the thermocouple and into the room. The well
      tube failure was caused by high-cycle fatigue from flow-induced vibration caused by
      vortex shedding in the direction of the sodium flow. Figure 2 shows the microscopic
      investigation of the fracture surface, which indicates fatigue striations. The designers
      had inappropriately applied the ASME Performance Test Code3 to the Monju tube
      thermocouple weld because the thermocouple was used in a location where
      vortex-induced vibrations can occur. Secondary measurement devices (e.g.,
      thermocouples) must be properly designed to prevent leaks. Flow-induced vibrations
      and complex fluid flows in these areas can cause failure and sodium leaks.




3
      The ASME Performance Test Code was redone in 2010. The code establishes the
      practical design considerations for thermocouple installations in power and process
      piping.

(5)     (Superphénix, December 1994): The reactor shut down because of an argon pressure
        seal leak [9]. Eddy current measurements identified a 30 mm (1.2 in.) long crack (half
        the tube circumference) at the weld between the argon supply pipe and the seal nozzle.
        The manufacturing defect led to unanticipated additional bending stresses at the weld,
        which caused inservice crack growth, likely from fatigue. Inspections of other pressure
        tube seals did not reveal a problem that would indicate a generic fabrication defect. A
        sleeve was inserted for repair. Initial fabrication defects during construction must be
        identified.

(6)     (BN-600, May 6, 1994): During the 15 year operation of the BN-600 reactor operation,
        30 sodium leaks (2 large and 28 small) occurred. The largest leakage of secondary
        sodium occurred from an IHX drainpipe. The incident took place during the replacement
        of an isolation valve while the reactor was shut down. A fire accompanied the sodium
        leak, and the leak caused equipment damage in the adjacent area. Approximately 1.2–
        1.3 cubic meters (about 1,000 kilograms (kg) 2200 pounds (lb)) of sodium leaked, but
        only several tens of kilograms of sodium ignited. The remaining sodium was retained in
        the smothering catch pan system and covered with extinguishing powder. Fabrication
        defects or poor management of thermal stresses leading to cracking at the welds caused
        these issues [22].

(7)     (Experimental Breeder Reactor (EBR)-II, 1968): A major sodium leak occurred in the
        secondary sodium system [23] in EBR-II. About 379 liters (100 gal) of hot sodium spilled
        onto the floor in the secondary sodium control room where sodium was purified. This
        was apparently a maintenance repair issue. A section of pipe had been removed as part
        of repairs on a bellows-seal isolation valve. The sodium in the line was frozen and,
        therefore, created a plug for the repair. However, the frozen sodium plug did not extend
        far enough beyond the repaired section, and molten sodium spilled onto the floor. A
        major fire erupted but was extinguished by a salt mixture (Metalex) that starved the fire
        of oxygen. The cleanup took 13 days. The piping material was Type 304 SS [23].
        Repair procedures in SFRs must be carefully planned.



                                               12
(8)   (EBR-II, November 14, 1970): A loud banging noise was heard near the IHX [23]. The
      noise source was within the Type 304 SS IHX inlet pipe. Visual examinations using both
      a periscope and a remote television system revealed that two support clips were
      damaged. One of the two support clips holding a 25.4 mm (1 in.) diameter evacuation
      tube in place was broken, and the top clip was loose. The missing clip supports allowed
      the evacuation tube to vibrate against the wall of the 324 mm (12 in.) outer diameter
      (OD) inlet pipe because of sodium flow. Both the 324 mm (12 in.) OD pipe and the 25.4
      mm (1 in.) tube showed evidence of wear. Repairs were made to permit operation.
      Although the incident report did not specifically identify the cause [23], it was likely the
      result of flow-induced vibration and thermal mismatch loading.

(9)   (Phénix, general): Phénix experienced 11 sodium leak events during its 35 years of
      operation. These problems were solved using various design modifications. An
      example of the only significant issue is the sodium leak into the inner space at the
      secondary sodium outlet header [10, 20, 24]. Different thermal expansion loads
      between the inner and outer shells that were underestimated in the original design
      caused the leak. Figure 3 illustrates the problem and solution; the redesign improved
      both the mixing of the secondary sodium outlet from the tube bundle (i.e., improving
      accommodation for thermal expansion) and the flexibility of the IHX hot header between
      the top closure plate and the inner shell (i.e., the upper right portion in Figure 3). Control
      of structural constraints in SFRs in regions of thermal expansion mismatch is an
      important design feature and must be considered during the license assessment of the
      plants.

(10)     (Phénix, November 1998, December 2000): Sodium leaks were found in the IHX of
         Phénix. The leaking tubes were near the upper tubesheet (see Figure 4). A
         metallurgical analysis revealed that caustic stress corrosion from the presence of
         polluted sodium (sodium hydroxide from air ingress) caused the cracking. The sodium
         was contaminated during testing of the IHX (i.e., air ingress during work on the
         secondary loop between 1995 and 1997). Proper procedures during repairs must be
         carefully maintained.

3.5   Sodium Piping Circuits

(1)   (FFTF, general): Overall, the main FFTF sodium systems performed with no major
      problems during the nearly 20 years they were in operation [16]. One exception was the
      occurrence of periodic flow and pressure oscillations in the secondary main heat
      transport system loops. An extensive investigation showed that the formation of periodic
      sodium flow vortexes developing at piping tees near the inlets of the heat exchangers
      caused the oscillations. After evaluating several potential concerns associated with
      these oscillations and investigating the means of eliminating them, the oscillations were
      deemed acceptable after changes were made to some plant control systems and
      operating procedures. The specific operational modifications were not specified.
      Sodium flows must be carefully assessed to prevent fatigue problems in SFRs.

(2)   (PFR, general): Operators discovered that oil from oil bearings had leaked into the
      primary loop. Following the oil ingress, the oil bearings were replaced with gas bearings
      [19]. Oil from pumps, bearings, and other places that leaks into the primary circuits of an
      SFR can produce methane gas through the core sodium coolant, causing reactivity
      effects and possible blockage of the subassemblies with solid carbon debris. In the case
      of the PFR, no reactivity effects were seen possibly because the oil was retained in the
      pump cone for a prolonged period and slowly broke down without the formation of large
      bubbles. Oil bearings should be avoided in SFR designs.

(3)   (BOR-5 and BOR-10, general): Over the operational lifetime of Russia’s BOR-5 and
      BOR-10, a combined total of 19 sodium leaks occurred in the sodium equipment and
      pipelines in the reactors [24]. A combination of inservice cracking and manufacturing
      fabrication defects, many of which were unspecified, caused the sodium leaks [24]. As
      with cracking in other operating SFRs, the valve leaks were probably caused by seal
      problems and improper seating of contacting parts. Pipe leaks not caused by
      manufacturing defects were likely caused by thermal fatigue and thermal expansion
      mismatch issues in the SS materials (i.e., X18H10T Russian designation, Type 316L
      equivalent). Reference [24] states that most of the sodium leaks actually happened in
      the early stages of reactor operation, which began in 1958, while the plant was
      mastering sodium technology and developing various equipment design solutions. No



                                              15
       sodium leaks occurred after 1986, and the plant was retired in 2002. No significant
       corrosion of materials in the sodium circuits occurred during the 40 years of operation.
       The earlier operation of these reactors demonstrates that fabrication defects during
       construction must be identified, especially with welds.

(4)    (PFR, 1987–1990): Another problem with the SG in the second decade of PFR
       operation was the deterioration of welds in the SS outer vessels of the superheaters and
       reheaters [19]. Leaks in reheater vessels in 1987 and 1988 revealed cracks (in one
       case, more than 100 mm (3.9 in.) long) in the original interplate welds. Subsequent
       inspections of the other vessels revealed large, nonpenetrating cracks similarly located
       in two of the superheater vessels. All cracks were in welds that were reworked during
       fabrication, or they occurred in areas where fabrication welds had overlapped. It was
       decided to dump the sodium, cut out the defects, and repair the vessels. However, one
       of the nonpenetrating cracks in the Superheater 3 vessel was not cut out. Later, an
       in situ assessment indicated a low likelihood of rapid propagation. Strain gauges were
       fitted to the crack region as monitors. Two repair methods were used. In the earlier
       method, the excised region was filled with weld metal against a backing plate. One of
       these repairs caused a further leak in 1990. In the later repair technique, a circular stub
       surrounding the defect area was welded on, the defect was removed, and the vessel
       was resealed by welding a cap on to the stub end. In subsequent years, this method
       evolved into a “stood off” patch, whereby the cracks were left in situ with holes drilled at
       both ends to stop them from propagating any further. An investigation of the problem
       indicated that delayed reheat cracking caused by the relaxation of weld residual stresses
       initiated the cracks. A high-temperature brittle intergranular mechanism driven by the
       residual stress field caused the cracks to subsequently grow. Repair procedures in
       SFRs must be carefully planned because weld residual stresses in repair welds are
       often highly tensile.

3.6   Steam Generator

SG failures are a particular concern for SFRs because of the potential reaction between molten
sodium and water. Materials must also meet the demanding conditions of the steam generator
environment. The review of the Phénix reactor [10] also describes general concerns of SFR
SGs.

(1)    (Phénix, 1974, 1975): Four water leaks were found in the economizer/evaporator inlet of
       the SGs [10, page 46]. The leaks were caused by wear of the subheader underframes
       from vibrations produced by high-pressure water flow in the orifice plates in the
       evaporators. As a result, the plate geometry was modified to improve flow
       characteristics of the orifice plates. Parts in contact must be prevented from wearing out
       in SFR SGs (tribology management).

(2)    (Phénix, 1982): A check valve that failed in the SG nitrogen filling system resulted in
       sodium slowly entering the water-steam region through a leak. The sodium reached a
       reheater isolation valve, creating two holes from corrosion (total area 2 square
       centimeters) in two SG tubes. Repairs were made, and the plant was restarted [10]. An
       accurate estimate of component reliability minimizes the chance of a sodium leak.

(3)    (Phénix, 1983–1984): Four separate sodium/water reactions took place in the SG
       reheater tubes. The leaks and subsequent sodium/water reactions were the result of
       cracking at tube-butt welds. The butt welds had excess metal leading to stress
       concentrations at the junction of the weld to the tube. Thermal transients caused these


                                               16
      cracks during startup operations as water mixed with steam, which caused thermal
      shock and fatigue. Consequently, the design was modified to reduce these transients,
      and excess butt weld material was removed [10]. Excess weld material in SFRs can
      lead to over constraint, increasing the likelihood of cracking under thermal transients.

(4)   (Phénix, general): Every 10,000 hours of operation, one of the burst discs operating
      near the hottest SG regions was removed, tested to ensure its burst rating, and
      replaced. Burst discs on the SGs are carefully monitored to prevent sodium/water
      reactions and excessive operating pressures in Phénix [10]. This was a precaution to
      prevent sodium/water fires. An accurate estimate of component reliability minimizes the
      chance of a sodium leak.

(5)   (BN-350, 1973): A major sodium fire occurred because of poor weld quality control of
      the SG tubing. The next Russian reactor (BN-600) was designed with the SGs in
      separate compartments to contain sodium/water fires. Additionally, the BN-600 was
      designed with an extra SG to allow the repair of fire-damaged SGs while the reactor
      continued to operate [14]. Initial fabrication defects during construction must be
      identified, especially with welds. Vendors should anticipate SG operational issues
      during design.

(6)   (BN-350, general): The BN-350 had six loops and six SGs, each of which had two
      vertical evaporators with field-type heat exchange tubes [25]. During testing, leakage
      was detected at welds where the tubes had been welded to the tube sheets. The
      materials were not identified; however, References [24, 25] describe the tube material as
      2.25Cr-1Mo steel. Metallographic examination showed the presence of microcracks in
      the tube weld joints caused by cold stamping. The SGs were repaired in situ; all the
      tubes were replaced, and all the welds were thoroughly examined. In 1974 and early
      1975, another incident occurred, the first three SGs were repaired, and the reactor
      operated at 350 megawatts thermal (MWt). After 9 days of operation, a large interloop
      leak was detected in SG No. 5. The reactor was shut down, and the valves in the lines
      of feedwater were closed. The drainage of water from the damaged evaporator was
      started. However, operators failed to drain the sodium properly because the drainage
      pipeline got plugged with reaction products. This apparently led to a violent
      sodium/water reaction. The majority of the evaporator heat-transfer tubes were
      corroded by the resulting sodium hydroxide solution; the evaporator housing was also
      partially damaged. About 300 kg (660 lb) of sodium went into the SG room. Proper
      procedures and quality control (particularly for welds) and repairs are important.

(7)   (BN-600, early operation): Leaks in the sodium interloops [15, 24] occurred during the
      first years of plant operation in the SG superheaters. Each interloop consisted of eight
      sections, including an evaporator module, a superheater module, and a reheater
      module. The evaporator modules were made of ferritic-martensitic steel (1Х2М) and
      superheater modules of Russian SS (ОH18N10Т, Type 316L equivalent). All cases of
      interloop leaks occurred at the point of tube-to-SG tube plate welds—a crack problem
      location found in many SFR designs. Deficiencies in the welding procedure and
      subsequent weld control also caused cracking. After design improvements, only one
      interloop leak was observed after 1985. Before these improvements, in the first three
      cases of interloop leaks, a fairly large amount of water went into the secondary circuit
      and a considerable quantity of sodium entered the tertiary circuit. Moreover, the first
      case showed hydrogen leakage through the packing bearings of the shutoff valves.
      Welds should be designed to minimize stresses during operation. Additionally weld



                                              17
       fabrication and inspection are important. Accurate estimates of valve reliability minimize
       sodium leaks.

(8)    (BN-600): As of 1997, the BN-600 Russian SFR had 27 sodium leaks, with the largest
       leak being 1,000 liters (264 gal) [15, 24]. Fourteen of the leaks resulted in fires. The
       causes of the leaks, their locations, or the materials used were not summarized;
       however, item 7 above includes some of them.

(9)    (Phénix, 1986): During a scheduled outage, a long-term sodium leak was discovered
       beneath insulation at an SG’s heater inlet T-part junction [10]. The leak occurred
       through a crack under the insulation that could not be easily detected (i.e., there was no
       smoke or other visible signs). Flow assisted corrosion removed 7 mm (0.28 in.) of the
       pipe’s thickness (the pipe is nominally 19 mm (0.75 in.) thick in this region). The piping
       insulation and molten sodium mixed to form a corrosive amalgam. This incident
       highlighted the need for better detection methods of corrosion and leaks, particularly in
       regions coated with insulation. It also highlighted the need to test chemical compatibility
       between molten sodium and insulation materials.

(10)   (PFR, 1974–1984): A total of 37 gas-space leaks occurred in PFR SG units, with 33 of
       these leaks in evaporators, 3 leaks in superheaters, and 1 leak in a reheater [19]. All the
       gas-space leaks originated at the welds between the tubes and the tube-plates. These
       leaks had a considerable effect on PFR availability; the highest annual load factor before
       1984 was only 12 percent. Gas-space leaks proved to be readily detectable by means
       of the hydrogen they generated. Careful washing of the tube-plates with hot sodium
       limited the number of leaks and avoided further damage, but it did not resolve the
       problem. The solution involved reinforcing all the tube-to-tube-plate welds in the three
       evaporators. Future SFRs should avoid the type of direct tube-to-tube-plate welds
       adopted initially at the PFR, which could not be heat treated after manufacture. In
       addition, austenitic steels are unsuitable for SFR SGs because of the high risk of caustic
       stress-corrosion damage following even small leaks. Flow-induced vibrations also
       contributed to some of the cracking at the welds.

(11)   (PFR, February 1987): A failure in Superheater 2 led to a major leakage of steam into
       the secondary sodium circuit [19] in the PFR. This caused a 28-week shutdown for
       repairs. After the leak event, an examination of the austenitic SS superheater revealed
       a fretting failure of a single tube, which had been subjected to unexpected flow-induced
       vibration. Thirty-nine neighboring tubes failed in the resulting sodium/water reaction
       event. This event rendered the unit unserviceable. One of the replacement tube
       bundles, stored on site as a strategic spare, was installed. The tube location suggested
       the possibility of a similar event occurring in the other original superheaters, and a
       decision was made to replace all of them. Observations of damage from vibration in the
       other units after removal warranted tube replacement. The sodium leaks in
       Superheater 2 demonstrated the possibility for a large number of tubes to fail from
       overheating in a period of a few seconds. This event was unlikely to cause significant
       over pressurization damage in the secondary circuit or the IHX, although it was possible.
       The incident led to a reassessment of the design-basis accident for the PFR SGs. In the
       case of the PFR, the design-basis accident was changed from a single double-ended
       guillotine fracture to 40 double-ended guillotine fractures spread over a period of
       10 seconds. Vibrations caused by mixing sodium flows of different temperatures must
       be carefully assessed to prevent fretting.




                                               18
(12)   (PFR, general): Cracking in PFR SG containment vessels was observed during
       maintenance activities. The evidence indicated that a delayed reheat mechanism driven
       by residual stresses in non-stress-relieved welds initiated cracking in PFR SGs. Weld
       repairs (Figure 5) made during the manufacturing process gave rise to conditions that
       favored cracking. 4 Weld residual stresses must be properly managed in systems where
       creep may occur and where corrosion may take place.




                 Figure 5 SG vessel repair methods (from [19, Figure 3.2])

(13)   (EBR-II, February 7, 1965): During a shutdown period with the SG system at ambient
       temperature, the operating crew reported liquid water between the steam and sodium
       tubesheets at the upper end of an evaporator (Figure 6). The double-tube design was
       made to minimize the possible interaction of sodium with water and steam. The source
       of water was traced to a crater crack in one of the tube-to-tubesheet welds
       (2-1/4Cr-Mo steel). It was a fabrication defect that the original helium leak test had not
       detected, but it was manually repaired. Access was gained by removing a section of the
       steam riser from the evaporator. No additional leaks were detected on any of the SGs.
       After this incident, additional inspections were made seven times from 1969 to 1978.
       Although there was some discoloration, there was no evidence of corrosion or fatigue
       cracking at the tube-to-tubesheet welds. Initial fabrication defects during construction
       must be identified.

       It is well known that repair welds often greatly increase tensile weld residual stresses.

3.7   Sodium Purification System Loop

(1)   (FBTR, 2002): After 17 years of operation, a sodium leak in India’s FBTR [25, 26]
      occurred in the purification building where the primary sodium purification piping resides.
      Publicly available sources do not precisely describe the event; however, it appears to
      have occurred because of a manufacturing defect in the bellows of sealed sodium
      service valves. The cleanup was particularly expensive and time consuming because
      the sodium was radioactive; its removal was a major effort.

(2)   (BN-600, July 1993): A crack on the auxiliary primary sodium purification system
      pipeline in a 48 mm (1.89 in.) diameter pipe [24] caused a sodium leak. This resulted in
      an insignificant radioactive discharge to the atmosphere (less than 5 microsieverts (0.5
      millirem)) at the plant boundary. The cause of the crack was not identified.

(3)   (PFR, June 1991): Overheating on the top bearing of a primary sodium pump [19]
      resulted in a manual trip of the PFR. The upper bearing of the pump lost a significant
      quantity of oil (up to 35 liters (9.25 gal)), which entered the primary sodium circuit. The
      primary pump filters were also damaged and required replacement. This was another
      incident of pump bearing failure that allowed oil into the sodium and resulted in a long
      shutdown. The bearing materials and the precise tribology of the failure were not
      reported. Oil bearings should be avoided whenever possible in SFRs.




                                               20
(4)    (FBTR, April 2002): While the reactor was operating at 17.4 MW t, 75 kg (165 lb) of
       primary sodium leaked from the purification circuit [26]. The leaked sodium froze on the
       floor and pipelines. The sodium was manually removed under inert gas purging. The
       leak came from the body of a bellows-sealed valve through one of the three blind holes
       used by the manufacturer for machining the valve body (Figure 7). Sodium leaked
       inside a purification compartment from a hole in the valve body. Because the problem
       was generic to that specific valve, all valves with that make were inspected and rectified
       by welding tightly fitting plugs. The leaked sodium converted to sodium hydroxide, which
       was neutralized by phosphoric acid and disposed of as active liquid effluent. The
       material thickness of the valve was 0.1 mm (0.004 in.). This thickness was sufficient to
       hold sodium for 17 years, which indirectly indicates that minimal corrosion occurs
       between SS and high-purity sodium. In a similar incident, sodium leaked past the failed
       bellows and went through a crack in the weld joint of the nipple used for mounting a
       spark plug detector. A faulty valve was later cut and replaced with a new valve (see
       Figure 7). Proper valve design and accurate estimates of valve reliability will minimize
       sodium leaks.

3.8   Emergency Sodium Cooling Circuits

(1)    (Superphénix, May 1991): A sodium leak occurred at the thimble of the thermocouple
       that measures the plugging indicator pellet temperature of a loop purification circuit.
       This design error led to varying temperatures in the area, which caused excessive
       expansion and distortion followed by cracking in the thimble. Thermal fatigue must be
       carefully assessed to prevent component failure [9].

(2)    (Superphénix, April 1994): An argon leak with sodium aerosols from a through-wall
       crack occurred on a secondary circuit gas line connecting the interspace of the rupture
       disk (discharge membranes for severe sodium/water reactions) to the cold storage tank.
       Corrosion caused by aqueous sodium hydroxide initiated the crack. The root cause was
       a poorly chosen gas fitting [9].

3.9    Hydraulics and Thermohydraulics

In nominal operating conditions, SFRs must handle hot sodium (550 degrees C) (1,022 degrees
F) (and cold sodium (400 degrees C (752 degrees F) on the primary side and 350 degrees C




                                               21
(662 degrees F) on the secondary side), which could lead to potential thermohydraulic concerns
[9], including the following:

•      fluctuation and thermal striping risks in the mixing zones with flows at different
       temperatures

•      complex sodium flow zones and interactions with flow patterns between subassemblies

•      thermal stratification of sodium and its consequences on the structures, including the
       inner vessel

•      cold shocks or hot shocks during transient conditions

In general, thermal loads in SFRs play a large role in structural performance and possible
cracking, as pressures are low. Chapter 18 of Reference [9] discusses thermohydraulic codes
that were developed and specifically verified during the design and operation of Superphénix.

3.10 Severe Accident

No SFR has had a severe accident; therefore, little information was found on this issue.
However, studies of BN-350 have been underway since the 1990s to ensure safety under
external dynamic loading, such as an earthquake [24]. Investigations were carried out to refine
the parameters of the maximum design seismic impact, including building structures, pipelines,
heat exchange equipment, and reactor vessels. Analysis of the consequences of seismic
impact on the reactor plant building structures, equipment, and pipelines showed existing safety
systems, such as the power supply system, the feedwater system, and the service water supply
to components important to safety, would be either partially or completely destroyed during a
seismic design-basis event. Taking this into account, a design was developed to provide for the
arrangement of safety equipment in the seismically robust part of the reactor building to ensure
the removal of reactor residual heat under seismic impact conditions. A separate design is
currently under development to provide reactor seismic protection by triggering the shutdown
system in response to signals from seismic sensors.

In addition, following a seismic safety upgrade study of the Phénix reactor in the late 1990s [28],
the plant’s buildings had to be reinforced, especially the structural steel work and steel
reinforcements in the reinforced concrete. The most extensive reinforcement work was in the
SG building in 2000. The licensing process needs to scrutinize the seismic and external
dynamic loading events of SFRs.

3.11   Inservice Inspection

Although very little information on inservice inspection was available, below is an example of
inservice inspection in SFRs.

The VISUS system was an ultrasound system developed to detect objects in opaque sodium in
Phénix [10, page 44]; it monitored the movement of the subassemblies within the reactor to
detect possible problems. After various adjustment problems, the VISUS system worked
extremely well. This device was a very useful instrument for “seeing through” sodium by
compensating for its opacity during potentially risky handling operations.




                                                22
Phénix used a periscope to monitor the space above the sodium in the storage drum [10]. In
June 1976, during the loading of new fuel subassemblies, an unusual object resembling a
metallic rod appeared on top of a handling flask in a breeder subassembly placed half an hour
before the rod’s appearance. After it was visualized and photographed several times, the object
disappeared. This unusual object was later determined to be a rod of solid sodium that froze in
the upper neutron shielding channel of the new fuel subassembly while it was being inserted
into the storage drum and that had been held upright under the effect of the hydrostatic
pressure. The temperature of the argon atmosphere in the storage drum was not high enough
to melt the sodium rod. It was subsequently melted by raising the temperature.

Phénix [10] set up a sound navigation and ranging (SONAR) system for inspection in 1993
following a negative reactivity trip. Its role was to detect movements in core subassemblies in
case a new reactivity trip occurred. The SONAR device also detected acoustic signals in the
core and measured the magnetic field in the vessel.

In 1982, the French safety authority requested a comprehensive inspection before fuel loading
in Superphénix [9]. A robotic device called the MIR (Fast Reactor Inspection Module) was
developed and could move in the containment vessels. The MIR used ultrasonic sensors for
inspecting welds. The MIR could also take distance measurements between components within
the SFR vessel. In addition, the MIR was equipped with cameras to make videos of the main
vessel and safety vessel (Figure 8). The use of the MIR robot and the excellent correlation
between the measurements carried out during construction and those taken by the MIR
demonstrated the feasibility of reactor vessel inservice inspection by ultrasonic techniques.




                   Figure 8 MIR inspection device (from [9, Figure 19.2])




                                               23
The last operational period for Superphénix extended from August 1994 to December 1996,
during which the most noticeable event was the occurrence of a small leak at the argon feed
tube of the gas sealing bell of one IHX in January 1995. Visual inspection using an endoscope
inserted in the tube above the reactor roof found the precise location of the leak. An internal
sleeve was expanded through pressurization to plug the leak without the need to remove the
IHX.

Superphénix had several methods for detecting sodium leaks [9]. In addition to conventional
fire detectors, 62 aerosol detection systems equipped with spectrophotometers were installed
throughout Superphénix. Approximately 270 spark plug-type devices were used to detect
sodium leaks. These devices operated on the principle that sodium leakage would cause a
short circuit between the ground and the spark plug electrode, thus triggering an alarm. The
devices proved to be unreliable for two principal reasons: (1) the degassing of products in the
thermal insulation deposited on the spark portal electrodes caused them to short to ground and
(2) keeping the spark plugs at high temperatures caused a loss of electrical insulation by
degrading the spark plug’s internal insulation. Roughly 900 beaded wires were also installed
beneath thermal insulation where the wires were set to short circuit during a sodium leak and
sound an alarm. In general, the spark plug and beaded wire detectors were unreliable, and a
“sandwich” detector was developed consisting of a steel sheet electrode placed between two
layers of insulating felt. The new detectors operated satisfactorily, and installation of the new
detectors began in 1992. However, the OpE of the detectors was curtailed because of the
closure of Superphénix.

In EBR-II, the primary containment shield tank consisted of an inner and outer Type 304 SS
tank with a 127 mm (5 in.) annulus between the two that was filled with inert gas and
surrounded by a 1.83 m (6 ft) concrete biological shield [27]. The annulus region was
continually monitored for sodium aerosols and air leakage through either tank wall (monitoring
devices not specified).

3.12   General Design Issues

During the design phase, many potential material and structural integrity issues were carefully
considered. The designers of Superphénix were much more cognizant of issues related to
thermal fluctuations in various components after operation of the Phénix. Some issues that
needed consideration are listed below; however, these issues were not necessarily problems in
the Superphénix plant. This section discusses lessons learned from OpE related to materials
performance, including favorable performance, and potential materials issues:

•      Thermal stratification and mixing between hot and cold sodium pools and zones must be
       managed because these can lead to thermal fatigue of the metal in these zones. In
       normal operation, sodium temperatures in Superphénix could vary between
       545 degrees C (1,013 degrees F) at the core outlet to 395 degrees C (743 degrees F) at
       the IHX outlets, raising the possibility of thermal stratification in the mixing zones and
       significant local stresses. Superphénix developed several thermohydraulic codes [9,
       Chapter 18] (e.g., SUPERCAVNA to model thermal stratification and NAJECO and
       NAJET for jet mixtures). In addition, the RCC-MR code had many developments and
       additions to handle high-temperature design and damage assessments to support
       Phénix and Superphénix.

•      For similar reasons, startup transient temperature fluctuations must also be managed
       because significant stresses can occur during the startup and shutdown transients. A



                                               24
       number of mockup tests in Superphénix validated thermohydraulic codes to ensure that
       thermal mixing and stratification were properly managed [9].

3.13   Other Topics
3.13.1 Steam Generator Tear Down of Experimental Breeder Reactor II

In April 1981, the superheater was removed from the EBR-II steam system for destructive
examination after more than 16 years of operation [23]. The superheater was disassembled in
a sequence that would progressively yield examination results before their obliteration by
subsequent disassembly. The steam surfaces contained lightly scattered corrosion pitting. The
pits were less than 0.25 mm (0.01 in.) in depth and appeared to have been formed early in the
life of the tubing, as evidenced by the oxide coating. The inside diameter measurements were
within 0.05 mm (0.002 in.) of the nominal fabricated diameter of 27.05 mm (1.06 in.). The
straightness measurements of the tubes indicated that some tubes were bowed and the
peripheral tubes were bowed more than the central tubes. The bowing was consistently in the
same direction (i.e., the tube bundle was twisted in one direction and then returned in the
opposite direction). Plasticity, creep from operations, or thermal expansion stresses could have
caused this distortion. Investigations of the duplex (double-walled) SG tubing indicated it was
“feasible that some creep or stress relaxation of the material has occurred in the tubes” [23,
page 13]. As discussed in Reference [57], EBR-II never experienced a sodium/water reaction
because of the use of duplex (double-walled) SG tubes (i.e., concentric brazed tubes swaged
together).

The SG tube-to-tubesheet welds were a matter of concern because they were located at the
highest stress point [23]. Liquid penetrant examination showed discontinuities in some welds.
The baffle nest, which was suspended from inadequate welds and had broken away from its
support ring, was discovered 22 inches from its as-built location. During operation, the baffle
nest had apparently “floated” in the sodium flow stream within 2 inches of its as-built location. In
general, however, the superheater was found to be in remarkably “like new” condition with even
the original soapstone marks clearly visible on the baffle nest. It may be useful to examine
teardown inspections of many other SFR components from this and other SFR plants to infer
more information on the long-term OpE of SFRs. There are probably other teardown results
that the review could not identify.

Sodium leaks occurred at all SFRs examined in this report at some point during their operational
lives. For example, the Phénix plant is typical for the types of leaks that have occurred in SFRs.
During its 35 years of operation, Phénix faced 31 sodium leaks. Most of these leaks were
located on welds of secondary loops and auxiliary circuits; fewer leaks occurred in the primary
system. A leak caused by corrosion occurred in Phénix only once. Each leak in Phénix had
consequences on plant availability but never on its safety. Table 2.11 of Reference [24]
provides a complete summary of all sodium leaks that occurred in Phénix. This summary table
shows the leak location, lead detection method used, amount of leakage, and temperature. The
fluid temperatures at the leak location ranged from about 100 degrees C (212 degrees F) to
550 degrees C (1,022 degrees F). In addition, during the 35 years of Phénix operation, five
sodium/water reactions occurred, all in the reheater module. Most began soon after the startup
of the plant after a shutdown and were located at butt welds on the hottest part of the SG tubes.
Startup and shutdown transients may have played a role in these leak reactions.

3.13.2 Potential Emergency Issues with Intermediate Heat Exchangers in
       Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors

During an emergency shutdown (scram) operation in an SFR, the IHXs (Figure 9) may
experience a thermal shock when the cold sodium arrives, which could lead to tube buckling
among other structural issues [9]. This is amplified in the case of an earthquake. Future SFR
designs must consider this issue. The IHX could operate up to 542 degrees C (1,008 degrees
F) in Superphénix.




               Figure 9 Superphénix heat exchanger (from [9, Figure 11.1])

3.13.3 Weld Reheat Cracking

The problem of delayed reheat cracking is a concern that can affect any welded structure
operating at high temperature and did affect welds at several SFR plants, including Phénix and
the PFR. At Phénix, the secondary piping and buffer tanks were susceptible to reheat cracking
[28, 29]. These components are made of Type 321 SS (stabilized with titanium) and were some
of the hottest components of the sodium envelopes of the SG superheater and reheater
modules. The secondary piping loop was not considered safety significant, which may also


                                              26
have reduced the welding quality and contributed to failure at the welds. Replacement with
316LN material in Superphénix, based on Phénix experience, minimized this issue. Reheat
cracking was also observed in PFR [19].

3.13.4 Double-Walled Tube Steam Generator Proposal

To enhance the reliability of SGs against a water/sodium reaction caused by tube failure, Japan
has developed a double-walled SG tube [30]. Figure 6 gives an example of a double-walled SG
tube in EBR-II. In addition, a collaboration between Japan Atomic Power Company and the
DOE is progressing on a performance test of an SG with a double-walled tube of 2Cr-1Mo steel.

3.13.5 Fuel Handling

Although fuel handling is not considered a structural or materials issue, mishaps during fuel
handling can significantly affect reactor operation and can potentially lead to structural
problems; this presents a challenge because sodium is opaque. Reference [10] discusses
some fuel incidents that occurred in EBR-II.

3.13.6 Sources of Plant Shutdowns

Superphénix shutdowns were dominated by failures in the steam side of the plant in accordance
with Table 2 [9]. The complexity of the nonnuclear portion of the plant, which included two
separate 600-megawatt-electric (MW e) turbo generators, may have been a strong contributor.

             Table 2 Origins of Superphénix Shutdowns (from [9, Figure 6.2])

                            Origin                       Contribution

3.13.7 Material Performance

Table 3 , adapted from [12], summarizes the materials used for major components in many of
the world’s SFR reactors. Different grades of SS dominate the material designs for the various
SFR components. Nickel-based superalloys (e.g., 9Cr-1Mo and modified 9Cr-1Mo (Grade 91))
are being strongly considered for cladding in future SFRs because of their good resistance to
void swelling.




                                                27
Selection parameters for reactor assemblies include tensile strength, creep response, low-cycle
fatigue performance, creep-fatigue interaction, and high-cycle fatigue caused by vibrations.
Fracture toughness and weldability are also important. Low-alloy steels are not considered
suitable in the SFR heat transport system because they usually do not have adequate
high-temperature material properties.

SFR criteria [31] for selecting the SG materials in Table 3 address the same concerns as those
discussed above for the reactors; however, good ductility and resistance to aging effects are
also important. Mechanical properties allowing performance in sodium are necessary, including
with regard to the material’s susceptibility to decarburization. Corrosion resistance to molten
sodium and aqueous sodium hydroxide, wear resistance, and proper weldability (noted in the
OpE) are important. Fabrication issues have also caused many failures. Reference [31, 32]
discusses the material requirements and selection criteria for SFRs.




                                              28
                      Table 3 Materials Selection for SFRs (from [12])




The Japan Atomic Energy Agency developed Type 316FR SS. This structural material is used
for the IHX in the Joyo reactor and is the lead material for the future fast breeder reactor in
Japan. It is an austenitic SS with improved high-temperature creep properties. The low carbon
content and the optimization of the phosphorus and nitrogen content enhance the strength of




                                              29
Type 316FR SS within the component range of the Japan Industrial Standards for Type 316 SS
[24].

3.13.8 Material Choices for Future Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors

This section discusses advanced SFR plants being built in other countries.

ASTRID (France)

ASTRID is the proposed advanced SFR (600 MWe) to be built in France. The material
candidates for ASTRID are based on prior SFR designs (i.e., Phénix, Superphénix, and
Superphénix 2) and the European Fast Reactor design [32]. For the materials in contact with
sodium, the choice of materials is based on the following three criteria:

(1)    corrosion resistance to sodium, including resistance to intergranular attack
(2)    easy to weld
(3)    sufficient/superior mechanical properties

Based on these criteria, the designers chose Type 316L austenitic SS with controlled nitrogen
for the main vessel and the internals operating at high temperature (550 degrees C) (1,022
degrees F) and possibly Type 304L for lower stress structures operating in the negligible creep
regime. These materials satisfy the above three criteria. The low carbon content ensures better
corrosion resistance, particularly against impurities that maintenance and repair activities may
introduce into the sodium.

Choosing an SG material is complex because of the need to consider various aspects. In
addition to the criteria noted above, SGs must have (1) sufficient creep resistance, (2) excellent
resistance to water and water vapor corrosion [32], (3) the ability to undergo inspections and
in situ maintenance and repair, and (4) in particular, a design that facilitates cleaning operations.
Phénix SGs used chromium-molybdenum-grade material, and the vapor collectors of
Superphénix were made of 2.25Cr-1Mo steel. Owing to its excellent oxidation resistance and
fabrication characteristics, Alloy 800H is a good candidate for ASTRID.

Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (India)

India’s next generation SFR, the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, will use of 304LN in place of
316LN for the cold-leg near-core components and the use of chromium-molybdenum in place of
304LN/316LN for the secondary sodium system are the focus areas for reducing material costs.
The 2.25Cr-1Mo steel is under study for the secondary sodium storage tank and auxiliary cold-
leg piping, and modified 9Cr-1Mo steel is being considered for the surge tank and hot-leg piping
[33].

3.14   Lessons Learned (Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor)

(1)    Sodium heat-transport systems experienced a significant number of leaks caused by
       poor weld design and poor weld quality control. Initial fabrication defects, particularly at
       welds, must be identified during construction. Welds should be carefully designed to
       minimize residual stresses, and direct tube-to-tube-plate welds should be avoided.
       Lowering the threshold for quality in welds and secondary loops has resulted in
       operational problems.




                                                 30
(2)    Repair procedures in SFRs must be carefully planned because weld residual stresses in
       repair welds are often highly tensile.

(3)    Reheat cracking is a concern in SFR components operating at high temperatures. In
       particular, weld repairs should be carefully managed because they may give rise to very
       high tensile residual stresses. Some types of austenitic SS (e.g., Type 321) are
       significantly more prone to reheat cracking than other austenitic SS.

(4)    Stresses induced by thermal expansion, particularly in areas of constraint, must be
       carefully considered for SFRs. These stresses have often been the source of structural
       integrity issues in SFR operation. In the case of Phénix, excess weld material led to
       over-constraint and cracking. The issue was resolved by eliminating unnecessary weld
       material.

(5)    Thermal fatigue (thermal striping) is a much more significant issue than it is for LWRs.
       Thermal fatigue in SFRs is caused by mixing sodium flows of different temperatures and
       must be carefully assessed to prevent fatigue.

(6)    Management of the startup and cooldown transients in SFRs to control vibration, thermal
       expansion loads, and possible fatigue issues in the components is important.

(7)    Avoid shrink-fit parts in pumps that could loosen during some thermal transients and
       inspect all pump welds carefully.

(8)    Oil-based lubricants should be avoided in SFRs.

(9)    Possible valve failures (all system valves especially those operating at high temperature)
       are a concern for SFRs. Valve reliability under operating conditions should be
       accurately determined.

(10)   Austenitic steels are unsuitable for SFR SGs because of the high risk of caustic
       stress-corrosion damage following even small leaks.

(11)   Testing should confirm the chemical compatibility between molten sodium and insulation
       material.

(12)   The proper choice of materials for SFRs requires complete material databases.

(13)   Secondary measurement devices (e.g., thermocouples) must be properly designed to
       prevent leaks. Flow-induced vibrations and complex fluid flows in these areas can
       cause failure and sodium leaks.

(14)   The failure of in-sodium components without an adequate means for removal and repair
       has resulted in costly and time-consuming recovery.

(15)   Sodium contamination and the consequent formation of sodium oxide have caused the
       binding of rotating machinery and control rod drives.

(16)   Better detection methods of corrosion and leaks are necessary, particularly in regions
       coated with insulation. The design phase should consider sensor placement and
       reliability under operating conditions. Inadequate or unreliable leak detection systems
       have caused extensive shutdowns because of sodium contamination and excessive
       sodium leaks with consequent fires.


                                               31
(17)   The licensing process needs to scrutinize seismic and external dynamic loading events
       of SFRs. During an emergency shutdown (scram), the IHX may experience thermal
       shock caused by the influx of cold sodium. This condition could lead to buckling and
       structural issues amplified by an external loading.

(18)   Reference [34] assesses applicable standards and codes for SFRs, and future
       companion reports will provide more information on such codes.

4 HIGH-TEMPERATURE GAS-COOLED REACTORS
As of April 2010, seven HTGRs have been designed and operated throughout the world [37].
Figure 10 [37] depicts these, along with information on the plants themselves. Reference [35]
discusses standards and codes applicable to HTGRs. This section describes OpE for HTGRs;
OpE is provided by component for many of these plants. This section of the report lists the
overarching lessons learned from the OpE with regard to material performance and structural
integrity. For reference, the OpEs are numbered for each component below. Chapter 2 of
Reference [37] provides a general, high-level overview of the OpE of these plants.

4.1   Fuel Structure

(1)   (Fort St. Vrain (FSV), October 1981): The licensee discovered a crack had propagated
      through two stacked fuel elements caused by high tensile stresses induced by
      irradiation. High tensile stresses can develop in the fuel elements caused by irradiation
      swelling at high temperatures, leading to cracking [36, 37]. Reference [38] summarizes
      attempts to improve graphite and carbon-graphite resistance to this effect. In general,



                                              33
      the operational history of FSV can be characterized by low availability (capacity factor)
      and inconsistent power production [39]. Graphite swelling under irradiation must be
      carefully evaluated with supporting data.

(2)   (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor (AVR), general): During a test campaign using
      special pebbles containing melt wires, Germany’s AVR pebble bed HTGR [40] showed
      maximum core temperatures greater than 1,280 degrees C (2,336 degrees F) at an
      average coolant outlet temperature of 950 degrees C (1,742 degrees F). The maximum
      core temperature was 200 degrees C (392 degrees F) greater than maximum design
      temperature of the fuel pebbles [41]. The excess temperatures led to higher releases of
      fission products and overheating of heat exchanger components and hot-gas ducts.
      Elevated temperatures may have also contributed to cracking of the graphite reflectors.
      There is no convenient way to monitor active core temperatures because pebble
      movement destroys standard detection equipment [41, 49]. Hot-gas temperatures were
      measured outside the reactor core, and computational codes were used to infer core
      temperatures. These codes were inaccurate as evidenced by the excessive core
      temperatures during the test campaign. One reason for the high temperatures is local
      pebble densification occurred, for which the designers did not account. Denser packed
      regions experienced a greater pressure drop and higher temperatures, as observed from
      measurements. Finally, the hot-gas streams observed in AVR may lead to overheating
      in parts of the SG or other metallic components. Chapter 11 of Reference [49] describes
      the AVR pebble bed fuel design, circulation, and computational temperature estimation
      procedures. These were originally based on a two-dimensional diffusion computer code
      but were improved to three-dimensional calculations in the 1980s as computer speed
      and memory improved. Reference [49] also describes the continuous processes of fuel
      pebble loading, pebble movement in the core, and pebble removal after burnup.
      Calculating HTGR core temperatures is problematic, particularly for pebble bed designs.

(3)   (Thorium High-Temperature Reactor (THTR), circa 1986): Germany’s THTR-300 (a
      pebble bed THTR) experienced higher temperatures than the design had anticipated
      [37]. Thermal fatigue from excessive thermal gradients across the core outlet, with a
      possible contribution from thermal neutrons, caused the insulation attachment bolts in
      the hot-gas duct to fail very early in the operation of the reactor. Uncontrolled core
      temperatures were thought to be a major cause. In addition, the insertion of control rods
      directly into the core during “unfavorable conditions” damaged the fuel elements. Such
      conditions were not mentioned. Calculating HTGR core temperatures is problematic,
      particularly for pebble bed designs.

(4)   (FSV, August 1984): Moisture entering into the helium cooling gas leached volatile
      chlorides from various sources, causing chlorine-induced stress-corrosion cracking of an
      SS control rod cable [37]. The solution was to replace the SS cables (the type was not
      identified) with corrosion-resistant Inconel cabling (the type was not specified). Because
      moisture can cause numerous structural corrosion and cracking issues, future HTGRs
      must manage moisture correctly and establish convenient methods to control it.

(5)   (AVR, 1971–1981): The reducer in the AVR was a slowly rotating slotted double disk at
      the end of the pebble extraction pipe (Figure 11). The fuel pebbles move through the
      disk and down the pipe. As the disk rotates, the pebbles are statistically distributed into
      the core. Numerous problems with this device occurred over the years. In
      January 1971, increased internal friction caused the drive motor to fail. In October 1974,
      a drive cam shear failure caused the reducer to malfunction. In July 1976, the bearing
      shield became loose, preventing the reducer from rotating and dispensing fuel. In


                                              34
      August 1976, a feather key sheared off in the reducer drive, stopping the reducer
      entirely. In December 1981, the drive no longer turned because of corrosion caused by
      water condensation. The repeated failure of the reducer, in addition to other
      components of the AVR, can be attributed to poor design [49]. Although these
      malfunctions did not necessarily endanger the public, the plant was shut down numerous
      times. Reference [49] discusses the numerous problems and incidents with the reducer
      that caused the plant to shut down. Other mechanical issues with the fuel dispensing
      and storage system that also occurred indicate a poor design of the entire system.

4.2   Core and Core Structures

(1)   (High-Temperature Reactor (HTR)-10, general): In China’s HTR-10 (a pebble bed
      reactor), non-uniform temperature distributions and deformation from neutron irradiation
      resulted in increased graphite wear caused by fretting of graphite blocks. The resulting
      graphite dust can clog the heat exchanger and induce erosion. Graphite damage must
      be minimized [37].

(2)   (AVR, May 1986): A visual inspection of the AVR core after defueling showed cracks in
      the bottom graphite reflector. A number of pebbles had sunk into various coolant
      penetration slits of the graphite bottom reflector structure and could neither roll off into
      the fuel discharge tube nor be removed by a manipulator [40]. The source of the
      graphite cracking was not reported.




                                               35
(3)   (High-Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR), 1999): During power-rise tests up to
      20 megawatts, the temperature unexpectedly rose at the core support plate caused by
      gas flow through gaps in the core support structure. Because a repair was not possible,
      the design margins were reevaluated. The analysis showed the higher temperatures
      could be tolerated. This illustrates the importance of considering helium flow in gaps for
      HTGR structures [47, 53].

(4)   (AVR, 1984): In 1984, AVR went through a rigorous inspection (after about 10 years of
      service) of the core structure to determine whether damage had occurred [49,
      Chapter 13], with special attention paid to examining the graphite. The inspection
      revealed little damage (Figure 12) to the graphite from material abrasion, corrosion, or
      shrinkage [49]. Graphite damage can be minimized through proper reactor design and
      quality control of graphite fabrication.




                         Figure 12 Graphite damage in an AVR reflector
                             after service (from [49, Figure 13.1-3])

(5)   (Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (Peach Bottom), 1967): Several factors
      contributed to the fatigue failures experienced by the control rods in ball-screw
      assemblies [37, 42]. The plant accumulated large numbers of cycles during the testing
      and personnel training period before plant startup. These additional cycles induced
      additional fatigue damage for which the plant was not designed. It is important to
      consider the accumulation of cycles in HTGRs during testing phases.

4.3   Reactor and Pumps

(1)   (FSV, lifetime): Moisture was a significant problem for the FSV reactor. The two primary
      sources of moisture were through the circulator bearings [37] and through small weld
      cracks in the prestressed concrete reactor vessel (PCRV) liner during startup. These
      small weld cracks sealed during high-temperature operation. FSV had limited ability to
      remove moisture once it got into the primary system because it lacked a reactor drain.
      By the end of November 1988, almost 3,800 liters (1,000 gal) of water were removed


                                              36
      from the reactor primary system [36]. Reactors should have a way to remove water that
      inadvertently enters the core.

(2)   (FSV, related to OpE No. 1 above): Moisture in the helium coolant could attack the
      graphite fuel element and cause corrosion of steel components, particularly the control
      rod drive mechanisms that affect reactivity. Because moisture can cause numerous
      structural corrosion and cracking issues, it must be managed correctly. It is critical for
      future HTGRs to have convenient methods for preventing moisture ingress.

(3)   (FSV, 1984): The PCRV tendon wires in the liner revealed significant corrosion issues
      [36]. The PCRV system consisted of 448 tendons, each made of 3.87 meters (12 feet
      10-1/4 in.) wires. Load cells were used to detect any loss of prestress. The licensee
      [36] found broken or corroded tendon wires in at least six tendons. The tendons are
      stored in sealed boxes to prevent moisture from entering. Prestress was used to
      produce compression in the PCRV liner (Figure 13). The material was steel containing
      0.72- to 0.93-percent carbon, 0.4- to 1.10-percent manganese, 0.1- to 0.35-percent
      silicon, and 0.04-percent (maximum) phosphorous and sulfur, and it met the
      requirements of ASTM A421, “Standard Specification for Stress-Relieved Steel Wire for
      Prestressed Concrete,” issued 1970 [43]. Sulfonate grease used on the tendon wires
      combined with oxygen from air ingress created acetic acid, which corroded the tendons.
      Several possible sources of corrosion were determined and summarized in
      Reference [36]. One example of tendon wire corrosion was traced to grease missing
      from the ends of tendon wires in combination with moisture in the sealed boxes where
      the tendon wires were stored before construction. Later, the plant found that
      microbiological attack had also contributed to the corrosion and damage to the wires
      [44]. PCRVs are subject to degradation mechanisms that traditional RPV steels do not
      encounter in service.




                                               37
        Figure 13 Prestressed tendon wires affected by corrosion damage (from [44])

(4)   (FSV, 1985): Moisture that collected between the 3/4-inch supply line in the 1/8-inch
      inlet line resulted in corrosion products that plugged the carbon steel helium pressurizing
      lines. Current HTGR designs may not encounter this issue if carbon steel is not used
      [36]. Carbon steel is particularly susceptible to corrosion from moisture ingress.

(5)   (AVR, first quarter 1980): In the AVR, four control rod drives were inserted from below
      into holes bored into the graphite reflector (the rods do not drive into the pebble bed). In
      general, the control rods performed well during operation. Inspection of the four control
      rods drives found cracks in the bellows of the couplings, and new bellows were welded
      in place. The cause of the cracking was not specified, but thermal fatigue may have
      caused the cracking because the cooling flow is anticipated to be complex near the
      bellows [49].

(6)   (AVR, fourth quarter 1974 and 1977): In 1974, a crack was found in the membrane
      compressor head of AVR [49, page 421]. Ten membrane compressors were used to
      pump helium from the reactor annulus into bottle storage and to transport it through the
      gas circuits and gas purification plants. After replacement, a similar crack was found in
      1977. The original cast iron head was replaced with an austenitic steel (the type was not
      specified). Although the exact cause of the cracking was not listed, it was suspected
      that thermal fatigue or creep fatigue5 caused it. Operators eventually replaced all of the


5
      Creep fatigue design and modeling techniques are quite complex, and all code bodies
      attempt to use very conservative interaction diagrams for assessment.


                                               38
      membrane compressors with dry running piston compressors because the latter were
      found to perform better. In general, the membrane compressors did not perform as well
      as the dry running piston compressor because the membranes had to be replaced
      frequently.

(7)   (HTTR, lifetime): The helium gas compressors (HGCs) in Japan’s HTTR had problems
      similar to Germany’s AVR [45]. The HTTR has 14 HGCs for circulating helium coolant in
      the helium purification system, helium gas sampling system, helium storage and supply
      systems, and the radioactive waste treatment system. These reciprocating-type
      compressors are specific to HTGRs. Degradation in compressor performance occurred
      repeatedly in the HTTR. In one incident in 2004, the volumetric flow rate of the HGCs
      decreased during operation. Inspections revealed that piston rings were abnormally
      abraded (Figure 14), which degraded the performance of the piston-ring seals. Further,
      the resulting graphite dust from the piston rings circulated in the primary cooling system.
      This dust increased differential pressures in the filters of the primary helium gas
      circulators [46], which increased pressures in the filters and overloaded them on the
      primary HGCs. As result, the HGCs had to be replaced often (this issue also occurs in
      the AVR). Originally, the replacement of these filters was not considered to be
      necessary throughout the lifetime of the design. To solve the abnormal abrasion of the
      piston rings, the tolerance for wear was optimized so that the flow rate of the HGCs did
      not fall significantly until the abrasion of piston rings reached the design limit. This also
      effectively prevented increases in differential pressures in the filters of primary gas
      circulators. Graphite dust should be minimized in HTGRs.




       Figure 14 Schematic of the exterior and internal mechanisms of a reciprocating
                                 HGC (from [45, Figure 4])



                                               39
(8)    (HTTR, lifetime up to 2010): Another generic problem with the HTTR compressors
       involved oil seal performance (a similar issue occurred in the AVR). Seal oil repeatedly
       leaked from the piston rod mechanism of the HTTR HGCs during long-term operations
       [47]. The oil seal forms a pressure boundary between the piston mechanics (helium
       side) and the piston crank mechanism (the atmospheric side; see also
       Figure 14). Studies showed that operating at high speeds caused leakage. This
       exceeded the material tribology limits of the seal material, which was originally a
       polyurethane-based material selected for its heat and radiation resistance. The solution
       was to replace the polyurethane seal material with a Teflon-based material that has
       superior heat resistance. This solution appeared to remedy the problem until at least
       2010. Whenever possible, oil seals should be avoided in HTGR designs.

(9)    (FSV, 1988): The FSV was shut down for a scheduled 12-week outage to replace
       bolting material on the helium circulators [37]. The bolts holding the insulation shroud
       and steam seal in place failed because of caustic stress-corrosion cracking. In addition,
       the “D” helium circulator experienced corrosion cracking and had to be shut down
       because of excessive circulator shaft vibration. The materials used for construction
       were not reported, but they were probably a type of ferritic steel. A small crack in the
       core support floor section of the liner cooling system [37] allowed entry of the moisture,
       which led to the corrosion. The cause of the crack was not specified. HTGR designs
       must account for corrosive effects and caustic embrittlement of fastener and other
       mechanical components.

(10)   (Dragon, 1968): An inspection found that the bearings in the Dragon single-stage
       centrifugal blowers were damaged during an inspection [37,48]. The bearing lubrication
       could not support the necessary weight without a minimum circulator rotational speed.
       The damage occurred during startup and shutdown, when the rotation speed was low
       and the bearings were under higher stresses. Reactor components should be able to
       withstand stresses during shutdown and lower than full-power operation.

4.4    Steam Generator/Turbine

(1)    (Peach Bottom, lifetime): The Peach Bottom reactor was the first nuclear power plant to
       use Alloy 800 for the SGs. The reactor did not experience any leaks during 7 years of
       operation [35]. Section 4.8 briefly discusses the use of Alloy 800 in HTGRs (Item (9).

(2)    (FSV, 1987): Hydraulic oil leaked from a valve causing a fire in the FSV turbine building.
       The hydraulically controlled valve was the Loop 2 main steam bypass valve [35]. The
       fire damaged many pieces of equipment and electrical cables, causing a loss of power to
       the control room radiation monitor. This incident was actually an operational problem
       [37] because the root cause determination found that a restrictor orifice was left out of a
       thermal relief for this valve, causing the relief to open and the pressure to surge. This
       fire is unusual because a steam pipe ignited it. HTGR designers must consider potential
       sources of fire that LWRs are not subject to, including the ignition of hydraulic oils [35].

(3)    (AVR, general): Water resulting from SG tube ruptures entered the AVR HTGR [40].
       The design lesson from the AVR experience is to ensure that the impact of SG tube
       ruptures in HTGRs will be limited (design-basis accident control). The cause of the tube
       ruptures was not identified. Placement of the SG relative to the reactor core is important
       to minimize water ingress. In the AVR, the SG was above the core.




                                               40
(4)   (AVR, 1971): The fuel oil line broke on a control accelerator for one of the two main
      steam turbine shutoffs in the AVR [49]. The fuel leak led to a fire, which spread rapidly
      until the turbine emergency switch was turned off. The fire was extinguished after
      15 minutes. The instruments and electrical installation of the engine console in front of
      the turbine were destroyed. Figure 15 shows the fire damage to the control stand of the
      turbine. The problem was traced to the fabrication of a clamped screw assembly. The
      bore of the union nut had sharp edges and had been pushed into the pipe, causing a
      small starter flaw. Line vibrations and thermal fatigue subsequently grew this crack to a
      critical size, leading to rupture. To prevent similar failures in the future, several design
      modifications were made. Among other design changes, welded-on cone couplings
      replaced the former couplings, and more elastic pipe loops replaced the rigid pipe
      connections to reduce vibrations.




             Figure 15 Fire damage in the turbine building (from [49 Figure 10.1-1])

(5)   (AVR, 1978): A serious water leak occurred in AVR [49]. Elevated moisture levels were
      observed earlier in the helium coolant gas. The source of the leakage in the AVR pebble
      bed reactor was difficult to find because there were many possible leak sources,
      including compressor leaks, leaks in the cooling unit of the gas purification system, leaks
      in the SGs, and leaks in cooling units of the coolant gas blowers. This particular leak
      was a 3-square-millimeter crack in pipe 8 of Superheater System 1. Reports are
      ambiguous, but the leak occurred either at a weld repair or at a pipe bend [49]. The
      cause of the crack was not specified, but creep fatigue ratcheting likely caused the
      crack. As a consequence, water sensors and drainage devices were installed. Lessons
      learned include (1) all containers, particularly the reactor vessels, must be equipped with
      drainage devices, and (2) U-shaped pipe lines are to be avoided. This incident caused
      an outage of about 8 months. The pipe materials were not specified.




                                               41
(6)    (AVR, January 1979): After the SG incident in the AVR (Item 5 above), a problem
       occurred during startup in the coolant gas circulator system [49]. Water had leaked into
       the circulator blower area from the cooling water circuit for the cooling gas blowers.
       This was likely a fabrication issue. Other than this incident, the helium cooling gas
       blowers performed very well during plant operation; however, screws and bolted
       connections may be problematic in HTGRs. The materials were not specified. This
       incident demonstrates the need for proper fabrication and quality control.

(7)    (Dragon, early operation): After the first Dragon boiler tube failure in 1967, the reactor
       suffered serious waterside corrosion troubles. Shutdowns for tube plugging were
       frequent, and 13 complete boiler changes took place [50]. The planned water treatment
       was typical for a conventional once-through boiler. In 1963, a reappraisal of the safety
       criteria showed that a reactivity accident caused by partial flooding of the reactor core
       could potentially occur and that some degree of neutron poisoning of the cooling water
       was essential. The only suitable poison under alkaline conditions was lithium sulphate
       at a required concentration of 1.6 percent, which caused waterside corrosion. This
       incident demonstrates that careful material selection is necessary and that the steam
       side can indirectly create significant safety issues.

4.5   Primary Piping

(1)    (EVA-II 6, general): The former 10-MW t EVA-II test loop experienced two SG leaks
       caused by a strong radial jet flow of the entering hot helium. This led to increased
       thermal stresses on the tube material, causing cracks in the tube walls when water
       entered into the helium system [51].

(2)    (FSV, life end): The event that finally brought FSV operations to an end was the severe
       cracking of the Incoloy 800 (Alloy 800) SG superheater headers. Replacement of the
       headers was deemed too expensive to justify a plant restart, given the long history of
       operational problems at the plant. The header cracks were caused by vibration and
       thermal cycling of the header material, which had coarse grain sizes, making the header
       prone to cracking [37].

(3)    (AVR, December 1982): A leak occurred in a compensator in the piping lines between
       the cooling tower and the machine housing building in the AVR [49]. The compensators
       were installed to compensate for thermal expansion mismatch effects to control thermal
       expansion mismatch stresses. The compensator fretted against a support because of
       the thermal expansion of the line. The materials and temperatures were not specified.
       Because of a lack of instrumentation, the incident was noticed only when the basement
       of the machine housing filled with water almost to the ceiling. Thermal stress
       management is important in HTGR plants.

(4)    (Dragon, 1974): The helium coolant leak rate detected during operation reached 2 kg
       (4.4 lb) per day [52]. The leaks were eventually found in the SS pipework leading to the
       helium purification plant. The leaks caused by chloride corrosion were small pits and
       crevices in otherwise healthy lengths of pipe. All leaks occurred in narrow sections of
       the pipes that were wrapped with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) insulating tape during
       commissioning to mark the various flowpaths and components of the circuit. When the
       circuit was approximately 80 to 120 degrees C (176 to 248 degrees F), the innermost

6 also referred to as the Single Tube Test Facility




                                                42
       layer of PVC tape decomposed and trapped gaseous hydrochloric acid under the outer,
       but still intact, layers of tape. (The PVC tape on pipe sections with temperatures of less
       than 80 degrees C (176 degrees F) remained stable; however, the PVC tape on pipe
       sections with temperatures above 120 degrees C (248 or degrees F) cracked and fell
       off.) After discovery of the leaks, all accessible SS pipework was inspected, and more
       than 200 tape markings were removed. All sections of SS pipework with tape markings
       were cleaned, and sections operating above 80 degrees C (176 degrees F) were
       replaced. This resulted in a 10-fold reduction of unaccounted helium losses, to 0.2 kg
       (0.44 lb) per day. This demonstrates the need for proper quality control during initial
       fabrication.

4.6   Severe Accident

(1)    (HTTR, 2005): The reactivity control system in Japan’s HTTR consists of two separate
       systems: (1) a control rod system and (2) the reserve shutdown system (RSS), which
       consists of boron. Pellets are released when necessary [45, 46, 53]. If the control rod
       system fails to engage, the RSS system drops the pellets into the core to shut down the
       reactor. During a periodic test of the RSS, a problem was observed. The oil seal at the
       top of the drive motor was distorted, and a spring had failed. A factory fabrication error
       of the seal caused the problem.

(2)    (HTTR, general): The Great East Japan Earthquake disaster of March 2011 caused
       accelerations in the HTTR greater than design values [45]. The HTTR was shut down at
       the time for a periodic inspection that found several problems, including sludge
       deposition in various components and a reduction in thickness of the combustor liner in
       an emergency gas turbine generator. These problems were caused by a long-time wave
       from the strong earthquake and were exacerbated by vibrations of fuel tanks and the
       long-time operation of the emergency gas turbine generators after the event. Future
       HTGRs would benefit by using this experience as an important lesson for protecting
       against the effects of earthquakes. In particular, backup systems must be properly
       designed to handle overloads as well. The comprehensive report from the Japan Atomic
       Energy Research Institute [53] contains details of the HTTR design but does not provide
       OpE.

4.7   Other Topics

The following other OpE topics do not necessarily fall into the component categories discussed
above and cover more general OpE:

(1)    (AVR, September 1971): While regenerating the cation exchanger of the condensate
       desalination system, hydrochloric acid leaked into the gravel bed filter at the AVR [49].
       This occurred because two shutoff valves in front of the gravel bed filter leaked, and
       operator error caused the relief valve between the two shutoff valves to close. To avoid
       corrosion damage, the power plant was shut down and the affected regions, including
       the SG, were rinsed numerous times with deionized water.

(2)    (HTTR, 2006): During a periodic inspection of the HTTR emergency gas turbine
       generators [45], small cracks were found on one of the three turbine blade nozzles. The
       cracks were attributed to fatigue from the long operating time of the emergency gas
       turbine generator. Emergency generators used in other industries do not operate as
       long, and this generator had 1,000 hours of operation. Therefore, generators that are



                                               43
      not specifically designed for nuclear operations should be avoided, and design-specific
      backup generators for the nuclear industry should be used.

(3)   Leak-before-break (LBB) issues are important for HTGR designs. Zhang et al. [54]
      summarizes LBB considerations for HTR-10 that should largely apply to next-generation
      HTGRs. Section 3 of Reference [35] provides a good overview of LBB considerations
      for HTGRs. As with LWRs, if LBB cannot be satisfied in an HTGR, a piping break must
      be postulated, and appropriate protection against the dynamic effects of the break must
      be provided for the safety-related structures, systems, and components. LBB analyses
      allow for the elimination of pipe whip restraints, jet impingement barriers, and other
      safety features. Formally, the LBB methodology could not be applied to piping that was
      degraded by an active degradation mechanism such as stress-corrosion cracking or
      creep cracking. The development of the xLPR code to place the active degradation
      mechanism of primary water stress-corrosion cracking in bimetallic welds in LWRs into a
      probabilistic framework may permit LBB considerations to bypass this requirement. A
      similar development could also be made for HTGR active degradation mechanisms such
      as creep, creep fatigue, and corrosion. Enhancing the xLPR code 7 to account for these
      degradation mechanisms is a logical step for the assessment of HTGR licenses. (See
      References [35, 54] for more details on the LBB application in HTGRs.) Finally,
      application of LBB requires robust leak detection methods.

(4)   The white paper on Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) high-temperature materials
      [55] provides an updated materials summary. The white paper discusses the candidate
      materials for the NGNP and the material applicable to the different HTGR systems. In
      addition, this summary includes composite applications and ceramic materials. This
      report also provides an update on the applicability of the ASME Boiler and Pressure
      Vessel Code (B&PVC) to HTGRs.

4.8   Design Considerations

(1)   The designers of the Dragon [52] frequently expressed concerns about prolonged
      contact between metal components in a high-temperature and high-purity helium
      environment causing a self-welding seizure; however, this concern did not materialize.
      Even under load and operating at a temperature of approximately 650 degrees C (1,202
      degrees F), frictional force was the only resistance to disengagement at the Nimonic
      control rod shield tube interface with the Monel 400 reflector head assemblies.

(2)   Power plant startup was carefully controlled in the AVR plant. To prevent high tensile
      stresses in the graphite during startup, which heats from the outside to the core, the
      hot-gas temperature could only be increased by 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees F) per
      minute. Reference [49] summarizes the procedures used to control temperature during
      startup (beginning on page 454) and summarizes the plant procedures used to control
      thermal gradients in the core graphite during reactor shutdown (beginning on page 456).

(3)   The coolant in HTGRs can result in flow-induced vibrations driven by energized gas flow.
      This flow across heat exchanger tubes, reactor internals, and other flexible locations can
      lead to damage and fatigue cracks if it is not properly managed. This problem also
      occurred with the Magnox and advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) with carbon

7
      A companion code, PROMETHEUS, might be more convenient for this purpose than the
      xLPR code.


                                              44
         dioxide coolant [37], and it can also affect helium-cooled reactors. Indeed, damage and
         crack development caused by unanticipated or incorrect loads have led to fatigue
         problems in both Magnox and AGR these reactors.

(4)      Graphite dust is produced in HTGRs from the contact and movement of graphite blocks.
         Graphite dust production is exacerbated by thermal gradients, coolant flow, vibration,
         and irradiation-induced swelling [37]. The generation of graphite dust is a particular
         problem in pebble reactors. This dust can be transported to other locations (e.g., the
         heat exchangers), reducing efficiency and possibly causing local “hot” spots that can
         lead to damage. Additionally, the graphite dust has a high propensity to absorb fission
         products, creating a radioactive graphite aerosol in the primary circuit. HTGR designers
         should seek to minimize the production of graphite dust and have methods (e.g., a
         filtering system) to remove the graphite dust from the helium loop.

(5)      Control rod lubrication in HTGRs is challenging. At HTGR temperatures, conventional
         lubricants (such as oils) cannot be used because of the high-temperature and the
         high-radiation environment [37]. Dry lubricants can be used; however, tribology studies
         of dry lubricants and their life performance is necessary and important to materials and
         component integrity.

(6)      Oil leaks in HTGRs were a persistent problem. The Peach Bottom HTGR experienced
         many leaks in the hydraulic components that were attributed to manufacturing defects in
         the sealing of surfaces [37]. Many of these leaks occurred in the compressor circulators.
         HTGRs should eliminate the use of hydraulics and oils as much as possible to prevent
         oil ingress from hydraulic components. This issue should be a source of scrutiny in
         licensing.

      (7) Research focused on the advancement of heat exchangers for HTGRs recommends the
          use of Alloy 617 for temperatures above 850 degrees C (1,562 degrees F) and Alloy
          800H for temperatures below 850 degrees C (1,562 degrees F) [37, 56]. This research
          demonstrated the stress rupture behaviors of these alloys and how carburization or
          decarburization can occur depending on the materials used and on the heat exchanger
          flow rates. The reactions between the metal and the impurities in the helium coolant can
          lead to carburization or decarburization, depending on the gas kinetics. Carburization
          reduces low temperature ductility and decarburization leads to a severe loss in creep
          strength, but control of the impurity contents can keep these effects within acceptable
          limits [37]. Specific high performance alloys are needed for the temperatures and
          environments experienced in HTGR reactor components. Alloy 617 and Alloy 800H are
          being considered for use in the NGNP IHX. 8

(8)      The preferred candidate materials for the hot duct are Alloy 617 or Alloy 800H,
         depending on the temperature [37, 56]. For Alloy 617, one important issue to consider is
         its high cobalt content. The activation of the cobalt could pose a problem in future
         HTGRs; however, in Germany’s HTGRs, cobalt was not present in the oxide scale;
         therefore, radioactive cobalt could not enter the hot-gas circuit even if the oxide spalled
         off.

(9)      The SG in Peach Bottom [37] was constructed of carbon steel, but the tubes were made
         from Alloy 800H. The Alloy 800H incurred significant age-hardening damage during
         operation but retained its ductility. These results were found acceptable and accurately

8
         ASME is presently adding Alloy 617 to the ASME B&PVC.


                                                 45
       predicted. One study showed that Alloy 800H has a lower oxidation rate if it is hot rolled
       instead of cold rolled [37, Section 4.1.5]. Germany’s THTR used cold-rolled Alloy 800,
       Grade 1, for the SG [37, Section 4.1.3]. The THTR header design required inelastic
       computational analyses (elastic-plastic creep) of 30 different transients with
       temperatures of about 560 degrees C (1,040 degrees F) [37]. The ASME B&PVC has
       recently added a simplified nonlinear computational analysis procedure for
       high-temperature designs. Although the THTR only operated for 6 years, Alloy 800,
       Grade 1, performed well.

(10)   The United Kingdom’s AGR SGs were predominantly helical coil and used carbon
       dioxide coolant. The AGR had failures associated with dynamic stress generated by the
       acoustic vibration (noise) from the gas circulators. SG designs must properly consider
       acoustic vibrations.

4.9    Lessons Learned (High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors)

(1)    High tensile stresses caused by irradiation swelling at high temperatures can develop in
       the fuel elements, leading to the cracking of graphite fuel elements.

(2)    Calculating HTGR core temperatures is challenging, particularly for pebble bed designs.
       Although it is easy to attribute the overheating in the AVR to limitations of computational
       codes in the 1980s, the core temperature of the prismatic HTTR has also been
       underestimated. Inaccurate core temperatures have led to thermal fatigue and fuel
       failure in pebble bed HTGRs.

(3)    HTGRs must account for all sources of possible corrosion, and corresponding materials
       and components must be designed appropriately. Early designers focused on the
       impact of moisture ingress and consequent graphite oxidation; however, OpE has
       demonstrated moisture ingress can also lead to structural component failures. Future
       HTGRs must be designed to consider all aspects of potential moisture ingress and
       incorporate methods for removing moisture from the core and primary loop.

(4)    HTGRs must consider the accumulation of cycles during testing. Failure to account for
       these additional cycles led to fatigue failures in both Peach Bottom and the AVR.

(5)    Management of thermal stresses is important in HTGRs because thermal expansion
       stresses can cause large loads and creep.

(6)    Corrosion of the prestressed concrete tendons could weaken the integrity of the reactor
       vessel and must be considered.

(7)    Abnormal abrasion in helium coolant compressors can degrade the performance of
       piston-ring seals and cause leakage. Compressors in HTGRs must be carefully chosen.

(8)    HTGR should be designed to minimize sources of graphite dust (e.g., fretting) and
       should include filters or other mitigating measures to address graphite dust.

(9)    Coarse-grained alloys are used for improved creep resistance, but such alloys are more
       vulnerable to cracking. Control of alloy grain sizes should be considered because alloys
       with excessive grain sizes may have insufficient toughness.




                                               46
(10)   Oil-based lubricants should be avoided in HTGRs. Lubricants have repeatedly leaked
       into the primary loop in HTGRs, and the high temperatures of the HTGRs are sufficient
       to ignite these oils elsewhere in the plant, even when they are not associated with the
       primary loop.

(11)   The design lesson from the Dragon experience is to ensure that the impact of SG tube
       ruptures in HTGRs will be limited (design-basis accident control).

(12)   Lessons learned from AVR include (1) all HTGR vessels, particularly the reactor vessels,
       must be equipped with drainage devices, and (2) “U-shaped” pipe lines are to be
       avoided.

(13)   HTGRs need to ensure the structural integrity of the RPV and the connecting vessels,
       especially under low helium flow and loss-of-forced convection conditions, because
       buckling may occur.

(14)   Backup systems must be properly designed to handle overloads and system upsets,
       such as seismic loads.

5 SUMMARY
5.1    Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors

SFR OpE is extensive and has resulted in the following conclusions with regard to materials and
structural performance:

•      As discussed in Reference [57], EBR-II never experienced a sodium/water reaction
       because of the use of double-walled (concentric tubes brazed or swaged together) SG
       tubes. This has not been the case with many other SFRs.

•      Corrosion of immersed SS components is not a concern if sodium purity is maintained.
       No significant corrosion of materials in the sodium circuits of BN-10 occurred during its
       44 years of operation; therefore, a 60 year life of the piping circuits in future SFR designs
       is possible.

•      Weld design and quality control are critically important. Residual weld stresses, excess
       weld metal, and weld constraints should be minimized, and direct tube-to-tube-plate
       welds should be avoided entirely in SFR. Lowering the threshold for quality in welds and
       secondary loops has resulted in operational problems.

•      Reheat cracking is a concern in SFRs in components operating at high temperatures. In
       particular, weld repairs should be carefully managed because they may give rise to very
       high tensile residual stresses. Some types of austenitic SS (e.g., Type 321) are
       significantly more prone to reheat cracking than other austenitic SS.

•      Stresses induced by thermal expansion, particularly in areas of constraint, must be
       carefully considered. The stresses have often been the source of structural integrity
       issues in SFR operation.

•      Thermal fatigue (i.e., thermal striping) caused by mixing sodium flows at different
       temperatures is a significant issue in SFRs.



                                                47
•      The management of startup and cooldown transients in SFRs to control vibration,
       thermal expansion loads, and possible fatigue issue is important.

•      Shrink-fit parts should be avoided because they could loosen during thermal transients.

•      Electromagnetic pumps have operated reliably.

•      Oil-based lubricants should be avoided in SFRs.

•      Possible valve failures (all system valves, especially those operating at high
       temperature) are a concern for SFRs. Valve reliability under operating conditions should
       be accurately determined.

•      Austenitic steels are unsuitable for SFR SGs because of the potential for caustic
       stress-corrosion damage following even small leaks.

•      Testing should confirm the chemical compatibility between molten sodium and insulation
       material.

•      Secondary measurement devices (e.g., thermocouples) must be properly designed to
       prevent leaks. Flow-induced vibrations and complex fluid flows in these areas can
       cause failure and sodium leaks.

•      Accurate detection methods of corrosion and leaks are necessary, particularly in regions
       coated with insulation. The design phase should consider sensor placement and
       reliability under operating conditions. Inadequate or unreliable leak detection systems
       have resulted in extensive shutdowns because of sodium contamination and excessive
       sodium leaks with consequent fires.

•      The licensing process needs to scrutinize seismic and external dynamic loading events
       of SFRs. During an emergency shutdown (scram), the IHX may experience thermal
       shock caused by the influx of cold sodium. This could lead to buckling and structural
       issues amplified by an external loading.

5.2   High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors

HTGR reactor OpE is extensive and has resulted in the following conclusions with regard to
materials and structural performance:

•      An accurate prediction of core temperatures in HTGRs is technically challenging. Even
       for more recent designs (e.g., the HTTR), core temperatures have exceeded anticipated
       design temperatures.

•      Moisture ingress and leakage events are a reoccurring problem with HTGRs. HTGRs
       should be designed to accommodate and mitigate moisture ingress.

•      Failures within the SG could introduce water into the primary loop and introduce the
       potential for unanticipated reactivity.

•      Management of thermal stresses is important in HTGRs because thermal expansion
       stresses can cause large loads and creep.


                                              48
•   HTGRs must consider the accumulation of cycles during testing. Failure to account for
    these additional cycles led to fatigue failures in both Peach Bottom and the AVR.

•   Pumps, seals, and compressors have a history of poor reliability in HTGRs. The design
    and testing of these components should be well scrutinized.

•   HTGR should be designed to minimize sources of graphite dust (e.g., fretting) and
    should include filters or other mitigating measures to address graphite dust.

•   Coarse-grained alloys are used for improved creep resistance, but they are more
    vulnerable to cracking. Control of alloy grain sizes should be considered because alloys
    with excessive grain size may have insufficient toughness.

•   Oil-based lubricants should be avoided in HTGRs.

•   HTGRs need to ensure the structural integrity of the RPV and the connecting vessels,
    especially under low helium flow and loss-of-forced convection conditions because
    buckling may occur.

•   Backup systems must be properly designed to handle overloads and system upsets,
    such as seismic loads.
