                                 criterion for the specificity of liquid
                                 metal embrittlement
                                 Masatake Yamaguchi1,2,3*, Tomohito Tsuru3,4, Mitsuhiro Itakura5 & Eiji Abe2,6

                                 Liquid metal embrittlement (LME) occurs in some solid–liquid metal elements’ couples (e.g., Fe-Zn and
                                 Al-Ga), called specificity. Although some material parameters like solubility and bonding energy were
                                 suggested as controlling factors, none could be attributed satisfactorily. Here we have unveiled the
                                 primary factor that governs the specificity of LME. From first-principles calculations compared with a
                                 systematic surveillance test result, we found that the grain-boundary (GB) adsorption energy shows
                                 near-zero values in all embrittling couples; the interaction between solid and liquid metal atoms is
                                 weak when an atom from the liquid state penetrates the grain boundary of the solid. Furthermore, we
                                 found that the calculated surface adsorption energy that promotes bond-breaking does not correlate
                                 to the specificity. Therefore, we consider that the penetration of a liquid metal atom surrounded
                                 by weakly interacting solid metal atoms is necessary before the bond-breaking assisted by surface
                                 adsorption occurs at a microcrack tip. This mechanism is also applicable for transgranular cracking
                                 along low-energy boundaries and crystal planes. While liquid metal atoms penetrate and diffuse
                                 into solid GB macroscopically before cracking, liquid metal’s surface adsorption stronger than GB
                                 adsorption should promote the bond-breaking of solid metal. In conclusion, the atomistic penetration
                                 precedes the surface-adsorption-assisted bond-breaking and controls the specificity of LME.


                                 Solid metals are susceptible to brittle fracture when they come in contact with certain liquid metals (e.g., Fe–Zn
                                 and Al–Ga). This phenomenon is called liquid metal embrittlement, discovered in ­18741. One of the most severe
                                 embrittling cases is polycrystalline aluminum alloys embrittled by liquid gallium; liquid gallium penetrates
                                 aluminum GBs macroscopically at high s­ peed2. Zinc atoms’ penetration, diffusion, and subsequent liquid zinc
                                 penetration into steel GBs have been observed because molten zinc embrittlement has attracted much attention
                                 by increasing steels’ s­ trength3,4, especially in the automotive industry. Luo et al. have clarified that bismuth forms
                                 bilayer interfacial phase along nickel G  ­ Bs5. In these cases, the subsequent embrittlement occurs due to the change
                                 in GB strength induced by liquid metal atoms existing in the GB before cracking.
                                     On the other hand, embrittlement occurs even when exposed to the liquid metal without detectable atomic
                                 diffusion or liquid penetration into GBs, lath boundaries in martensitic steel, and crystal lattice planes. Although
                                 liquid mercury atoms do not seem to penetrate and diffuse into high-strength steel’s GBs and lath boundaries,
                                 embrittlement does occur along those b        ­ oundaries6. Even single crystal aluminum exhibits embrittlement by
                                 liquid ­gallium7 after significant plastic deformation. The extremest example is the mercury embrittlement of
                                 single and polycrystal zinc; fracture occurs within seconds after coating mercury on stress-loaded ­zinc8. In this
                                 way, LME occurs even if liquid metal atoms do not exist along the cracking path before fracture.
                                     One of the curious phenomena that many researchers have tried to solve is why embrittlement occurs or does
                                 not occur depending on a given solid–liquid metal elements’ couple under a specific test condition. Such selectiv-
                                                                  ­ ME9, which has been known for over a century, yet it is not well understood. Some
                                 ity is called the specificity of L
                                 material parameters suggested as controlling factors are solubility, interatomic bonding energy, and intermetallics
                                 formation. However, none of them could be attributed to the specificity of LME s­ atisfactorily10,11. We considered
                                 that the crucial atomistic mechanism of LME must be hidden behind the mystery of the LME specificity.

                                        Figure 2.  A proposed atomistic process of bond-breaking at a microcrack tip. (a) Atomistic penetration of
                                        liquid metal atom into GB, lath boundary, or lattice plane of solid metal at a microcrack tip under tensile stress.
                                        (b) The atomistic penetration of liquid metal with weak interaction (near-zero energy) stretches and weakens
                                        the solid metal bonding. (c) The subsequent surface adsorption of liquid metal atoms achieves the bond-
                                        breaking of solid metals. The process of (a–c) repeats, and the microcrack grows when the weak interaction
                                        criterion is satisfied.

                                        surface energy reduction is well known to enhance temper embrittlement by solute ­segregation12–16 (Supple-
                                        mentary Note). However, our calculated surface adsorption energy of a liquid metal atom on solid metal does
                                        not correlate with the specificity of LME, as shown in Fig. 1b–d. So, what is the atomistic picture that explains
                                        these calculated results consistently?
                                            We have further proposed an essential atomistic process necessary for bond-breaking at a microcrack tip,
                                        which controls the specificity of LME, as shown in Fig. 2. We consider that when embrittlement occurs without
                                        experimentally observing liquid metal atoms’ existence along the cracking path before fracture, it must be neces-
                                        sary for the liquid metal atom to penetrate at least one or several atomic distances and then be surrounded by
                                        weakly interacting solid metal atoms at a microcrack tip. The penetrated liquid metal atom probably stretches
                                        highly and weakens chemically solid–solid metal bonds across the GB, lath boundary in martensitic steel, and
                                        crystal lattice plane. Subsequently, not-yet-penetrated liquid metal atoms break the stretched and weakened
                                        interatomic solid metal bonds by adsorbing on these solid atoms. As a result, solid metal bond-breaking occurs
                                        irreversibly due to surface termination by liquid metal atoms, and therefore the microcrack grows. When the
                                        GB adsorption energy shows far-from-zero values, an intense repulsive or attractive interaction prevents the
                                        atomistic penetration or the subsequent bond-breaking, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. Again to say, such an
                                        atomistic process may be impossible to be detected by modern experimental technology. Computational simula-
                                        tions will be necessary to make the process visible.For an experiment showing the specificity of LME, we paid
                                        particular attention to the result by Rostoker et al.10, as shown in Table 1. Although the experimental details are
                                        missing, this experiment conducted a bending test for more than 40 combinations (couples) under similar test
                                        conditions (except temperature). In this respect, this experiment is an incomparable one. The solid metals used
                                        are high-strength steel (Fe) and high-strength alloys of Al, Mg, and Ti, while liquid metals used are Hg, Ga,
                                        Na, In, Li, Se, Sn, Bi, Tl, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Te. According to the test results, solid–liquid couples were classified as
                                        either “Embrittlement” when a brittle fracture occurs with no apparent prior plastic deformation, probably GB
                                        cracking, or “Non-embrittlement” when such a severe brittle fracture does not occur. It is important to note that
                                        some non-embrittlement elements in Table 1 can cause embrittlement under other tests. For example, while Pb
                                        and Bi are non-embrittlement elements in Table 1, these liquid metals (Pb and Bi) cause embrittlement on T91
                                        martensitic steel, where cracking occurs mainly along its lath boundaries with significant plastic ­deformation17.
                                            To elucidate the mystery of the specificity of LME, we considered that the GB and surface adsorption energy
                                        of a liquid metal atom must be essential for the following reasons. In many cases, severe embrittlement occurs
                                        along GBs with almost no prior plastic deformation. Additionally, the (fracture) surface adsorption of a liquid
                                        metal atom must be necessary because the energy lowering effect by the adsorption can promote bond-breaking
                                        at a microcrack tip of solid metal. Based on these ideas, we calculated the GB and surface adsorption energies
                                        of a liquid metal atom in solid metals for many couples (Methods and Supplementary Fig. S2). The energies’
                                        standard (zero value) for the liquid metal atom is the energy of its crystalline state at absolute zero temperature.
                                        It is a good approximation for the liquid state because the energy difference between the liquid and its solid
                                        states, i.e., the latent heat (enthalpy) of fusion (Supplementary Table S2)18, is insignificant compared with the
                                        size of the GB and surface adsorption energy.
                                            As another factor, the interstitial lattice dissolution energy of the liquid metal atom in solid metal might
                                        be significant for the embrittlement along the low-energy lath boundary and crystal lattice plane. This type of
                                        embrittlement occurs with a large amount of prior plastic deformation, which is necessary to cause microcrack
                                        nucleation in non-GB cracking. Unfortunately, in our experiences, the interstitial lattice dissolution energy
                                        becomes too large in positive to obtain the numerically converged value. Although the tensile stress concentra-
                                        tion at the microcrack tip is critical, it is not easy to include that in the calculations. For this reason, we calculated

                                            that satisfy the weak interaction (near-zero energy) criterion show embrittlement. The atomistic embrittling

                                            criterion is satisfied. Contrarily, the atomistic penetration or the subsequent bond-breaking is suppressed in the

                                                  As stated in the fourth paragraph, we found an excellent correlation between the specificity of LME and
                                             our calculated GB adsorption energies of liquid metal elements in iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), as shown in
                                             Fig. 1a–c. All the embrittling elements have near-zero GB adsorption energy, while non-embrittling elements
                                             have far-from-zero GB adsorption energy, except Al-Cd. For iron (steel), indium causes more GB embrittlement
                                             than lead and bismuth in Martin’s ­experiment17; indium consistently appears at near-zero energy more closely
                                             than lead and bismuth (Fig. 1a). It is also reasonable for sodium to have far-from-zero GB adsorption energy
                                             (Fig. 1a) because sodium rarely causes the embrittlement of ­steel19. The calculated GB adsorption energies of
                                             zinc in iron (Fig. 1a) and gallium in aluminum (Fig. 1c) are slightly negative values; these imply the zinc and
                                             gallium atoms feel weak attractive interaction from iron and aluminum GB, respectively, and can easily penetrate
                                             the GBs. Therefore, zinc diffusion in iron GB and liquid gallium penetration in aluminum GB would realize
                                            ­quickly2–4. In addition, we can see a similar trend as in iron and aluminum for both magnesium and titanium
                                             cases (Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4). However, there are only two embrittling couples for each, magnesium or
                                             titanium. Nickel also shows asimilar trend using other experimental data (Supplementary Note and Fig. S6).
                                             Therefore, the trend of near-zero GB adsorption energy for the embrittling couples must be a necessary condition
                                             and criterion for the occurrence of LME.
                                                  Furthermore, we found an exciting trend; a continuous view from the calculated energies, as shown in
                                             Fig. 1a–c (Supplementary Fig. S3, S4, and S6), indicates that the embrittlement seems to occur in a transition
                                             region from where the intermetallic compounds exist to where they do not exist (Supplementary Note). The
                                             greater the GB adsorption and lattice dissolution energies are negative, the more the solid–liquid couple forms
                                             intermetallic compounds. Rostoker et al. pointed out that the embrittling couples tend not to form intermetal-
                                             lic ­compounds10, while our criterion further narrowed down the allowed range of embrittling couples from the
                                             viewpoint of interaction energy.
                                                  Lowering the cohesive energy of the GB plane caused by surface adsorption by liquid metal can promote
                                             interatomic bond-breaking in solid metal as in temper e­ mbrittlement12–16 (Supplementary Note). Figure 1b–d
                                             shows the calculated surface adsorption energies of liquid metal atoms on iron’s (111) and aluminum’s (012)
                                             surfaces. The surface adsorption energies were substantial negative values in all the couples, indicating that all
                                             liquid metal elements decrease the surface energy by adsorption and thus assist bond-breaking. However, there
                                             seems to be no correlation between the size of surface adsorption energy and the specificity of LME. It indicates
                                             that the condition of near-zero GB adsorption energy is more significant for LME than the surface adsorption
                                             strength. We expect the trend in Fig. 1b–d not to change if we could calculate solid–liquid interface energy
                                             because the cohesion of low melting temperature metal may not be significant. Finally, the above energetic
                                             considerations have led us to the following atomistic picture.

                                      We explain the atomistic process of bond-breaking of solid metal induced by liquid metal atoms at a micro-
                                  crack tip (Fig. 2) in more detail than already stated in the fifth paragraph. When embrittlement occurs, the GB
                                  adsorption energy of a liquid metal atom is near zero; the liquid metal atom weakly interacts with the surrounded
                                  solid atoms. Thus, the liquid metal atom can penetrate inside the microcrack tip at least one or several atomic
                                  distances through the stretched solid metal’s interatomic bonds under tensile stress concentration with the
                                  help of thermal activation. This atomistic penetration of the liquid metal must have some weakening effects on
                                  solid–solid bonds: a highly stretching effect and a chemical effect due to the change of atoms’ arrangement. Then,
                                  not-yet-penetrated liquid metal atoms adsorb the solid metal atoms consisting of the weakened interatomic bonds
                                  and then cause the bond-breaking at the microcrack tip. Although the energy reduction by surface adsorption
                                  can promote bond-breaking, the strength of surface adsorption does not correlate with the specificity of LME,
                                  as shown in Fig. 1b–d. Therefore, we conclude that the atomistic penetration of a liquid metal atom into solid
                                  metal’s GB plane is necessary before surface-adsorption-assisted bond-breaking occurs. Even when we cannot
                                  find liquid metal atoms experimentally along the cracking path before fracture, we consider that the atomistic
                                  penetration of liquid metal atoms precedes the bond-breaking of solid metal. Further, we consider that a similar
                                  atomistic penetration and the subsequent bond-breaking can occur at low-energy boundaries like lath in mar-
                                  tensitic steel and crystal lattice planes, after significant prior plastic deformation and subsequent microcrack
                                  nucleation having huge stress concentration at its tip in the case of non-GB cracking.
                                      On the other hand, if the atomistic penetration and subsequent diffusion of liquid metal atoms into GBs are
                                  experimentally observed, as in the case of galvanized (Zn) embrittlement of high-strength steel, the embrit-
                                  tlement is triggered by grain boundary decohesion at a first stage. We can recognize a significant decohesion
                                  effect of Zn on Fe GB in our calculated results; the surface adsorption energy of Zn (–0.8 eV/atom) is much
                                  lower than the GB adsorption energy of Zn (–0.3 eV/atom), which data can be found in Fig. 1a,b. This energy
                                  difference assists bond-breaking and surface formation in solid metal’s GB. Recent experimental and theoretical
                                  studies confirm this decohesion m   ­ echanism4,20 in more detail. We emphasize here that our proposed criterion
                                  of LME includes this type of embrittlement. When liquid metal atoms can penetrate and diffuse into solid met-
                                  als’ GB macroscopically, the decohering effect on GB will emerge for almost all liquid metals because they have
                                  a significant surface adsorption effect stronger than GB adsorption in solid metals. (Supplementary Fig. S10).
                                      When the weak interaction (near-zero energy) criterion of atomistic penetration is not satisfied, we consider
                                  the bond-breaking does not occur for the following reasons, as shown in Fig. 3 (Supplementary Fig. S9ac). When
                                  the GB adsorption energy of liquid metal is enormously positive, the liquid metal atom cannot penetrate the GB
                                  plane even at a microcrack tip because of the intense repulsive interaction between liquid and solid atoms. When
                                  the GB adsorption energy is significantly negative, the attractive interaction (bonding) is so intense between
                                  solid and liquid atoms that it prevents solid–solid bond-breaking near the liquid atom, even if the atomistic pen-
                                  etration occurs. Therefore, the bond-breaking (embrittlement) does not occur when the GB adsorption energy
                                  appears in the far-from-zero energy region, where the weak interaction criterion is not satisfied. The boundary
                                  between embrittlement and non-embrittlement regions depends on various material and test parameters such
                                  as hardness, grain size, temperature, strain rate, etc.
                                      We should note our idea for the role of dislocations on LME. It comes from the analogy of the study of GB
                                  decohesion by one of the authors (MY)16. We consider that the easier the bond-breaking occurs at a microcrack
                                  tip, the lesser the dislocations emit from t­ here14,15, reducing fracture toughness and fracture stress in LME. The
                                  present study assumes that surface and GB adsorption itself does not affect the dislocation emission because the
                                  influence of liquid metal on dislocation is not evident theoretically and experimentally. Further investigation is
                                  necessary on this point.Finally, we note that our study is not applicable for a different type of LME; it is primarily
                                  a dissolution or corrosion reaction, the crack growth takes hundreds or thousands of hours. Recently, Norkett
                                  et al.11 have classified LME into three categories: (a) solid metal seems to be brittle simply by touching liquid
                                  metal (e.g., Fe-Hg, Fe-Pb, Fe-Bi, and Zn-Hg)6–8, (b) liquid metal atoms diffuse as an atom or penetrate as a liquid
                                  along the GB plane of solid metal over a macroscopic distance (e.g., Fe-Zn, Al-Ga, and Ni-Bi)2–5, and (c) GBs
                                  are selectively eroded by corrosion reactions (e.g., a preferential dissolution of Cr and Ni from stainless steel in
                                  molten sodium)21. Our proposed weak interaction criterion based on experimentally unseen atomistic penetra-
                                  tion adapts well to type (a) embrittlement. Furthermore, this criterion is also applicable to type (b) embrittlement;
                                  the penetration of liquid atoms surrounded by weakly interacting solid atoms is necessary before it develops to a
                                  macroscopic diffusion of atoms, interfacial phase, or liquid penetration, and then fracture occurs. On the other
                                  hand, the criterion does not adapt to type (c) embrittlement due to corrosion and dissolution reactions, in which
                                  solid metal atoms dissolve into liquid metal.

                                  Methods
                                  First‑principles calculations. We conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations by using
                                  Vienna Ab initio Simulation Packages (VASP)23,24 using the Projector-Augmented Wave method with Perdew-
                                  Burke-Ernzerhof exchange–correlation (PAW-PBE) p        ­ otentials25,26. The cutoff parameter of the plane-wave basis
                                  set was 360 eV. (For the Cu system, we use 385 eV).
                                      We calculated the substitutional lattice dissolution (solid solution) energy of liquid metal elements in the solid
                                  metal lattice using supercells. Supplementary Table S1 summarizes solid metal crystal structures, magnetism,
                                  supercell size, and k-point sampling. The total energy of superlattice having n solid metal atoms is Etot   sc (n), and
                                  that having n − 1 solid metal (M) atoms and one X atom Etot (n − 1, X). The total energy per one liquid metal
                                                                                                  sc
                                  atom in the most stable elemental substance is Eatom (X). Supplementary Table S2 shows the crystal structure of
                                  each liquid metal in low temperatures. These cells were fully relaxed. The lattice dissolution energy of element
                                  X in a solid metal is defined by.

                                            in five solid metals. Supplementary Table 1 shows the details of cell modeling for solid metals. The unit cells,
                                            including grain or twin boundary and its two fracture surfaces, are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Supple-
                                            mentary Table S3 summarizes the calculated grain boundary and surface energies. The grain or twin boundary
                                            energy is about half of the surface energy for each solid metal except for titanium. Therefore, it indicates that
                                            these boundaries are high-energy ones. On the other hand, the boundary energy is relatively low for titanium.
                                            It may be why the calculated adsorption energies of grain boundary and surface correlate very well with each
                                            other in the titanium case, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.

                                            in the case of metal grain boundaries, the grain boundary energy often does not change significantly in response
                                            to the insertion or removal of the atoms that construct the grain boundary. The distinction between substitutional
                                            and interstitial types is not meaningful for the segregation of solute elements in disordered structures of metal
                                            GB. For this reason, we choose the lower GB adsorption energy from the above two equations.
                                                Supplementary Fig. S2 shows an example of the calculated grain-boundary and surface adsorption energies
                                            of a Pb atom in the solid metal of iron. We can see that the lattice dissolution energy calculated by using the BCC
                                            5 × 5 × 5 supercell is close to the corresponding energies calculated by using the grain boundary modeling cell.
                                            Thus, it indicates that the cell size we used is sufficient. As explained below, we take the fcc solid-state energy of
                                            Pb as an approximation of its liquid state energy.

                                            Energies of liquid state. All of the liquid metals examined here are low-melting-point metals. Thus, the
                                            latent heat, the difference in energy between solid and liquid, is on the order of at most 0.02–0.18 eV/atom18, as
                                            shown in Supplementary Table S2, which is not significant compared with the scale of lattice dissolution and sur-
                                            face adsorption energies. For example, the Pb energy difference between solid and liquid states is only 0.05 eV/
                                            atom at melting temperature. This energy difference is too small to influence the interpretation of the calculated
                                            results (Fig. 2). For this reason, we consider that there is no problem adopting the solid-state energy of the liquid
                                            metal element as an approximation of the liquid state energy.
